<h2 class="chap1">CHAPTER I<br />

<span class="s08">STRAINED RELATIONS</span></h2>

<p>Some people, you will admit, can absorb experience
in gentle little homeopathic doses,
while others require it to be shot into them by
hypodermic injections.</p>

<p>Certainly my Dresden-china mother up to the
time of my birth had been forced to take this
bitter medicine in every form, yet she had never
been known to profit by it. She would not, it is
true, fly in the very face of Providence, but she
<i>would</i> nag at its coat tails.</p>

<p>"You might as well name this child 'Praise-the-Lord,'
and be done with it!" complained the
rich Christie connection (which mother had always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
regarded as outlaws as well as in-laws),
shaking its finger across the christening font into
mother's boarding-school face on the day of my
baptism. "Of course all the world knows you're
<i>glad</i> she's posthumous, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But with Tom Christie only six weeks in
spirit-land it isn't decent!" Cousin Pollie finished
up individually.</p>

<p>"Besides, good families don't name their children
for abstract things," Aunt Hannah put in.
"It&mdash;well, it simply isn't done."</p>

<p>"A woman who never does anything that isn't
done, never does anything worth doing," mother
answered, through pretty pursed lips.</p>

<p>"But, since you must be freakish, why not call
her Prudence, or Patience&mdash;to keep Oldburgh
from wagging its tongue in two?" Aunt Louella
suggested.</p>

<p>Oldburgh isn't the town's name, of course, but
it's a descriptive alias. The place itself is, unfortunately,
the worst overworked southern capital
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
in fiction. It is one of the Old South's
"types," boasting far more social leaders than
sky-scrapers&mdash;and you can't suffer a blow-out
on <i>any</i> pike near the city's limits that isn't flanked
by a college campus.</p>

<p>"Oldburgh knows how I feel," mother replied.
"If this baby had been a boy I should have named
him Theodore&mdash;gift of God&mdash;but since she's a
girl, her name is <i>Grace</i>."</p>

<p>She said it smoothly, I feel sure, for her Vere
de Vere repose always jutted out like an iceberg
into a troubled sea when there was a family
squall going on.</p>

<p>"<i>All</i> right!" pronounced two aunts, simultaneously
and acidly.</p>

<p>"All <i>right</i>!" chorused another two, but Cousin
Pollie hadn't given up the ship.</p>

<p>"Just name a girl Faith, Hope or Natalie, if
you want her to grow up freckle-faced and marry
a ribbon clerk!" she threatened. "Grace is every
bit as bad! It is indicative! It proclaims what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
you think of her&mdash;what you will expect of her&mdash;and
just trust her to disappoint you!"</p>

<p>Which is only too true! You may be named
Fannie or Bess without your family having anything
up its sleeve, but it's an entirely different
matter when you're named for one of the prismatic
virtues. You know then that you're expected
to take an A. B. degree, mate with a millionaire
and bring up your children by the Montessori
method.</p>

<p>"Bet Gwace 'ud ruther be ducked 'n cwistened,
anyhow!" observed Guilford Blake, my five-year-old
betrothed.&mdash;Not that we were Hindus and
believed in infant marriage exactly! Not that!
We were simply southerners, living in that portion
of the South where the principal ambition in
life is to "stay put"&mdash;where everything you get
is inherited, tastes, mates and demijohns&mdash;where
blood is thicker than axle-grease, and the dividing
fence between your estate and the next is properly
supposed to act as a seesaw basis for your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
amalgamated grandchildren.&mdash;Hence this early
occasion for "Enter Guilford."</p>

<p>"My daughter is not going to disappoint me,"
mother declared, as she motioned for Guilford's
mother to come forward and keep him from profaning
the water in the font with his little celluloid
duck.</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure," warned Cousin Pollie.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll&mdash;I'll risk it!" mother fired back.
"And if you must know the truth, I couldn't express
my feelings of gratitude&mdash;yes, I said <i>grat</i>itude&mdash;in
any other name than Grace. I have had
a wonderful blessing lately, and I am going to
give credit where it is due! It was nothing less
than an act of heavenly grace that released me!"</p>

<p>At this point the mercury dropped so suddenly
that Cousin Pollie's breath became visible.
Only six weeks before my father had died&mdash;of
delirium tremens. It was a case of "the death
wound on his gallant breast the last of <i>many</i>
scars," but the Christies had never given mother
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
any sympathy on that account. He had done
nothing worse, his family considered, than to get
his feet tangled up in the line of least resistance.
Nearly every southern man born with a silver
spoon in his mouth discards it for a straw to
drink mint julep with!</p>

<p>"Calling her the whole of the doxology isn't
going to get that Christie look off her!" father's
family sniffed, their triumph answering her defiant
outburst. "She is the living image of Uncle
Lancelot!"</p>

<p>You'll notice this about in-laws. If the baby
is like their family their attitude is triumphant&mdash;if
it's like anybody else on the face of the earth
their manner is distinctly accusing.</p>

<p>"'Lancelot!'" mother repeated scornfully. "If
they had to name him for poetry why didn't they
call him Lothario and be done with it!"</p>

<p>The circle again stiffened, as if they had a
spine in common.</p>

<p>"Certainly it isn't becoming in you to train
this child up with a disrespectful feeling toward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
Uncle Lancelot," some one reprimanded quickly,
"since she gives every evidence of being very
much like him in appearance."</p>

<p>"My child like that notorious Lancelot
Christie!" mother repeated, then burst into tears.
"Why she's a Moore, I'll have you understand&mdash;from
here&mdash;down to <i>here</i>!"</p>

<p>She encompassed the space between the crown
of my throbbing head and the soles of my kicking
feet, but neither the tears nor the measurements
melted Cousin Pollie.</p>

<p>"A Moore! Bah! Why, you needn't expect that
she'll turn out anything like you. A Lydia Languish
mother always brings forth a caryatid!"</p>

<p>"A what?" mother demanded frenziedly, then
remembering that Cousin Pollie had just returned
from Europe with guide-books full of
strange but not necessarily insulting words, she
backed down into her former assertion. "She's
a Moore! She's the image of my revered father."</p>

<p>"There's something in that, Pollie," admitted
Aunt Louella, who was the weak-kneed one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
the sisters. "Look at the poetic little brow and
expression of spiritual intelligence!"</p>

<p>"But what a combination!" Aunt Hannah
pointed out. "As sure as you're a living woman
this mouth and chin are like Uncle Lancelot!&mdash;Think
of it&mdash;Jacob Moore and Lancelot
Christie living together in the same skin!"</p>

<p>"Why, they'll tear the child limb from limb!"</p>

<p>This piece of sarcasm came from old great-great-aunt,
Patricia Christie, who never took
sides with anybody in family disputes, because
she hated them one and all alike. She rose from
her chair now and hobbled on her stick into the
midst of the battle-field.</p>

<p>"Let me see! Let me see!"</p>

<p>"She's remarkably like Uncle Lancelot, aunty,"
Cousin Pollie declared with a superior air of
finality.</p>

<p>"She's a thousand times more like my father
than I, myself, am," poor little mother avowed
stanchly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span></p>

<p>"Then, all I've got to say is that it's a devilish
bad combination!" Aunt Patricia threw out, making
faces at them impartially.</p>

<p>And to pursue the matter further, I may state
that it was! All my life I have been divided between
those ancient enemies&mdash;cut in two by a
Solomon's sword, as it were, because no decision
could be made as to which one really owned me.</p>

<p>You believe in a "dual personality"? Well,
they're mine! They quarrel within me! They
dispute! They pull and wrangle and seesaw in
as many different directions as a party of Cook
tourists in Cairo&mdash;coming into the council-chamber
of my conscience to decide everything I do,
from the selection of a black-dotted veil to the
emancipation of the sex&mdash;while I sit by as helpless
as a bound-and-gagged spiritual medium.</p>

<p>"They're not going to affect her future,"
mother said, but a little gasp of fear showed
that if she'd been a Roman Catholic she would
be crossing herself.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course not!" Aunt Patricia answered.
"It's all written down, anyhow, in her little hand.
Let me see the lines of her palm!"</p>

<p>"Her feet's a heap cuter!" Guilford advised,
but the old lady untwisted my tight little fist.</p>

<p>"Ah! This tells the story!"</p>

<p>"What?" mother asked, peering over eagerly.</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;nothing, except that the youngster's
a Christie, sure enough! All heart and no head."</p>

<p>Mother started to cry again, but Aunt Patricia
stopped her.</p>

<p>"For the lord's sake hush&mdash;here comes the
minister! Anyhow, if the child grows up beautiful
she may survive it&mdash;but heaven help the
woman who has a big heart and a big nose at
the same time."</p>

<p>Then, with this christening and bit of genealogical
gossip by way of introduction, the next
mile-stone in my career came one day when the
twentieth century was in its wee small figures.</p>

<p>"I hate Grandfather Moore and Uncle Lancelot
Christie, both!" I confided to Aunt Patricia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
upon that occasion, having been sent to her room
to make her a duty visit, as I was home for the
holidays&mdash;a slim-legged sorority "pledge"&mdash;and
had learned that talking about the Past, either for
or against, was the only way to gain her attention.
"I hate them both, I say! I wish you
could be vaccinated against your ancestors. Are
they in you to stay?"</p>

<p>I put the question pertly, for she was not the
kind to endure timidity nor hushed reverence
from her family connections. She was a woman
of great spirit herself, and she called forth spirit
in other people. A visit with her was more like
a bomb than a benediction.</p>

<p>"Hate your ancestors?"</p>

<p>At this time she was perching, hawk-eyed and
claw-fingered, upon the edge of the grave, but
she always liked and remembered me because I
happened to be the only member of the family
who didn't keep a black bonnet in readiness upon
the wardrobe shelf.</p>

<p>"I hate that grandfather and Uncle Lancelot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
affair! Don't you think it's a pity I couldn't
have had a little say-so in that business?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;no&mdash;I don't know&mdash;ouch, my knee!"
she snapped. "What a chatterbox you are, Grace!
I've got rheumatism!"</p>

<p>"But I've got 'hereditary tendencies,'" I persisted,
"and chloroform liniment won't do any
good with my ailment. I wish I need never hear
my family history mentioned again."</p>

<p>"Then, you shouldn't have chosen so notable a
lineage," she exclaimed viciously. "Your Grandfather
Moore, as you know, was a famous
divine&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;and Uncle Lancelot Christie was an
equally famous infernal," I said, for the sake of
varying the story a little. I was so tired of it.</p>

<p>She stared, arrested in her recital.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Well, if you call a minister a divine, why
shouldn't you call a gambler an infernal?"</p>

<p>"Just after the Civil War," she kept on, with
the briefest pause left to show that she ignored
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
my interruption, "your grandfather did all in his
power&mdash;although he was no kin to me, I give
him credit for that&mdash;he did all in his power to re-establish
peace between the states by preaching
and praying across the border."</p>

<p>"And Uncle Lancelot accomplished the feat in
half the time by flirting and marrying," I reminded
her.</p>

<p>She turned her face away, to hide a smile I
knew, for she always concealed what was pleasant
and displayed grimaces.</p>

<p>"Well, I must admit that when Lancelot
brought home his third Ohio heiress&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The other two heiresses having died of neglect,"
I put in to show my learning.</p>

<p>"&mdash;many southern aristocrats felt that if the
Mason and Dixon line had not been wiped away
it had at least been broken up into dots and
dashes&mdash;like a telegraph code."</p>

<p>I smiled conspicuously at her wit, then went
back to my former stand. I was determined to be
firm about it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't care&mdash;I hate them both! Nagging old
crisscross creatures!"</p>

<p>She looked at me blankly for a moment, then:</p>

<p>"Grace, you amaze me!" she said.</p>

<p>But she mimicked mother's voice&mdash;mother's
hurt, helpless, moral-suasion voice&mdash;as she said
it, and we both burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"But, honest Injun, aunty, if a person's got to
carry around a heritage, why aren't you allowed
to choose which one you prefer?" I asked; then,
a sudden memory coming to me, I leaped to my
feet and sprang across the room, my gym. shoes
sounding in hospital thuds against the floor. I
drew up to where three portraits hung on the
opposite wall. They represented an admiral, an
ambassador and an artist.</p>

<p>"Why can't you adopt an ancestor, as you can
a child?" I asked again, turning back to her.</p>

<p>"Adopt an ancestor?"</p>

<p>Her voice was trembling with excitement,
which was not brought about by the annoyance
of my chatter, and as I saw that she was nodding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
her head vigorously, I calmed down at once and
regretted my precipitate action, for the doctor
had said that any unusual exertion or change of
routine would end her.</p>

<p>"I only meant that I'd prefer these to grandfather
and Uncle Lancelot," I explained soothingly,
but her anxiety only increased.</p>

<p>"Which one?" she demanded in a squeaky
voice which fairly bubbled with a "bully-for-you"
sound. "<i>Which one</i>, Grace?"</p>

<p>"Him," I answered.</p>

<p>"They're all hims!" she screamed impatiently.</p>

<p>"I mean the artist."</p>

<p>At this she tried to struggle to her feet, then
settled back in exhaustion and drew a deep
breath.</p>

<p>"Come here! Come here quick!" she panted
weakly.</p>

<p>"Yes, 'um."</p>

<p>She wiped away a tear, in great shame, for she
was not a weeping woman.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" she said angrily. "Thank God!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
That awful problem is settled at last! I knew I
couldn't have a moment's peace a-dying until I
had decided."</p>

<p>"Decided what?" I gasped in dismay, for I
was afraid from the look in her eyes that she was
"seeing things." "Shall I call mother, or&mdash;some
one?"</p>

<p>"Don't you dare!" she challenged. "Don't
you leave this room, miss. It's <i>you</i> that I have
business with!"</p>

<p>"But I haven't done a thing!" I plead, as weak
all of a sudden as she was.</p>

<p>"It's not what you've done, but what you
<i>are</i>," she exclaimed. "You're the only member
of this family that has an idea which isn't framed
and hung up! Now, listen! I'm going to leave
you something&mdash;something very precious. Do
you know about that artist over there&mdash;James
Mackenzie Christie&mdash;our really famous ancestor&mdash;<i>my</i>
great-uncle, who has been dead these sixty
years, but will always be immortal? Do you
know about him?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I know!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm going to leave&mdash;those letters&mdash;those
terrible love-letters to <i>you</i>!"</p>

<p>I drew back, as if she'd pointed a pistol straight
at me.</p>

<p>"But they're the skeleton in the closet," I repeated,
having heard it expressed that way all my
life.</p>

<p>She was angry for a moment, then she began
laughing reminiscently and rocking herself backward
and forward slowly in her chair. Her
face was as detached and crazy as Ophelia's over
her botany lesson, when she gets on your nerves
with her: "There is pansies, that's for thoughts,"
and so forth.</p>

<p>"Yes, he left a skeleton&mdash;what was considered
a skeleton in those days&mdash;Uncle James&mdash;our family's
great man&mdash;but such a skeleton! People
now would understand how wonderful it is&mdash;with
its carved ivory bones&mdash;and golden joints
and ruby eyes! <i>You little fool!</i>"</p>

<p>"Why, I'm proud!" I denied, backing back, all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
a-tremble. "I'll love those letters, Aunt Patricia."</p>

<p>"You'd better!"</p>

<p>"I'll be sure to," I reiterated, but her face suddenly
softened, and she caught up my hand in
her yellow claw. She studied the palm for a
moment.</p>

<p>"You'll understand them," she sighed. "Poor
little, heart-strong Christie!"</p>

<p>And, whether her words were prophetic or delirious,
she had told the truth. I have understood
them.</p>

<p>She gave them over into my keeping that day;
and the next morning we found her settled back
among her pillows, imagining that all her brothers
and sisters were flying above the mantlepiece
and that the Chinese vase was in danger. Another
day passed, and on Sunday afternoon all
the wardrobe shelves yielded up their black bonnets.</p>

<p>I was not distressed, but I was lonely, with an
ultra-Sabbathical repression over my spirits.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<p>"I believe I'll amuse myself by reading over
those old letters," I suggested to mother, as time
dragged wearily before the crowd began to
gather. But she uttered a shriek, with an ultra-Sabbathical
repression over its tone.</p>

<p>"Grace, you amaze me!" she said.</p>

<p>"She's really a most American child!" Cousin
Pollie pronounced severely, having just finished
doing the British Isles.</p>

<p>After this it seemed that years and years and
years of the twentieth century passed&mdash;all in a
heap. I awoke one morning to find myself set in
my ways. Most women, in the formation of their
happiness, are willing to let nature take its course,
then there are others who are not content with
this, but demand a postgraduate course. I, unfortunately,
belonged to this latter class. Growing
up I was fairly normal, not idle enough at
school to forecast a brilliant career in any of the
arts, nor studious enough to deserve a prediction
of mediocre plodding the rest of my life; but after
school came the deluge. I was restless, shabby
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
and <i>single</i>&mdash;no one of which mother could endure
in her daughter.</p>

<p>So I was a disappointment to her, while the
rest of the tribe gloated. The name, Grace, with
all appurtenances and emoluments accruing thereto,
availed nothing. I was a failure.</p>

<p>"My pet abomination begins with C," I chattered
savagely to myself one afternoon in June,
a suitable number of years after the above-mentioned
christening, as I made my way to my own
private desk in the office of <i>The Oldburgh Herald</i>,
pondering family affairs in my heart as I went.
"Of course this is at the bottom of the whole
agony! They just can't bear to see me turn out
to be a newspaper reporter instead of Mrs. Guilford
Blake. And I hate everything that they
love best&mdash;cities, clothes, clubs, culture, civilities,
conventions, chiffons!"</p>

<p>I was thinking of Cousin Pollie's comment
when she first saw a feature story in the <i>Herald</i>
signed with my name.</p>

<p>"Is the girl named Grace or Disgrace?" she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
had asked. "Not since America was a wilderness
has the name of any Christie woman appeared
outside the head-lines of the society column!"</p>

<p>"The whole connection has raised its eyebrows,"
I laughed, when I met the owner and
publisher of the paper down in his private office
the next day. He was an old friend of the family,
having fought beside my revered grandfather,
and he had taken me into the family circle of the
<i>Herald</i> more out of sympathy than need.</p>

<p>"That's all right! It's better to raise an eyebrow
than to raise hell!" he laughed back.</p>

<p>But on the June afternoon I have in mind,
when I hurried up-town thinking over my pet
abominations beginning with C, I was still a fairly
civilized being. I lived at home with mother in
the old house, for one thing, instead of in an independent
apartment, after the fashion of emancipated
women&mdash;and I still wore Guilford Blake's
heirloom scarab ring.</p>

<p>"Aren't your nerves a little on edge just now,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
Grace, from the scene this morning?" something
kept whispering in my ears in an effort to tame
my savagery. It was the soft virtuous personality
of my inner consciousness, which, according to
science, was Grandfather Moore. "You'll be all
right, my dear, as soon as you make up your
mind to do the square thing about this matter
which is agitating you. And of course you are
going to do the square thing. Money isn't all
there is."</p>

<p>"Now, that's all rot, parson!" Uncle Lancelot,
in the other hemisphere of my brain, denied stoutly.
"Don't listen to him, Grace! You can't go
on living this crocheted life, and money will bring
freedom."</p>

<p>"He's a sophist, Grace," came convincingly
across the wires.</p>

<p>"He's a purist, Grace," flashed back.</p>

<p>"Hush! Hush! What do two old Kilkenny
cats of ancestors know about my problems?" I
cried fiercely. Then, partly to drown out their
clamor, I kept on: "My pet abominations in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
several syllables are&mdash;checkered career&mdash;contiguous
choice&mdash;just because his mother and mine
lived next door when they were girls&mdash;circumscribed
capabilities&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And the desire of your heart begins with H,"
Uncle Lancelot said triumphantly. "You want
Happy Humanness&mdash;different brand and harder
to get than Human Happiness&mdash;you want a
House that is a Home, and above all else you
want a Husband with a sense of Humor!"</p>

<p>"But how could this letter affect all this?" I
asked myself, stopping at the foot of the steps to
take a message in rich vellum stationery from my
bag. "How can so much be contained in one
little envelope?"</p>

<p>After all, this was what it said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"My dear Miss Christie:</p>

<p>"While in Oldburgh recently on a visit to Mr.
Clarence Wiley"&mdash;he was the author of blood-and-thunder
detective stories who lived on Waverley
Pike and raised pansies between times&mdash;"I
learned that you are in possession of the love-letters
written by the famous Lady Frances Webb
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
to your illustrious ancestor, James Mackenzie
Christie. Mr. Wiley himself was my informer,
and being a friend of your family was naturally
able to give me much interesting information
about the remaining evidences of this widely-discussed
affair.</p>

<p>"No doubt the idea has occurred to you that
the love-letters of a celebrated English novelist
to the first American artist of his time would
make valuable reading matter for the public; and
the suggestion of these letters being done into a
book has made such charming appeal to my mind
that I resolved to put the matter before you without
delay.</p>

<p>"To be perfectly plain and direct, this inheritance
of yours can be made into a small fortune
for you, since the material, properly handled,
would make one of the best-selling books of the
decade.</p>

<p>"If you are interested I shall be glad to hear
from you, and we can then take up at once the
business details of the transaction. Mr. Wiley
spoke in such high praise of the literary value of
the letters that my enthusiasm has been keenly
aroused.</p>

<p>
"With all good wishes, I am,<br />

<span class="left25">"Very sincerely yours,</span><br />

<span class="left45">"Julien J. Dutweiler."</span></p>
</div>

<p>There was an embossed superscription on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
envelope's flap which read: "Coburn-Colt Company,
Publishers, Philadelphia." They were
America's best-known promoters&mdash;the kind who
could take six inches of advertising and a red-and-gold
binding and make a mountain out of a
mole-hill.</p>

<p>"'Small fortune!'" I repeated. "Surely a
great temptation <i>does</i> descend during a hungry
spell&mdash;in real life, as well as in human documents."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="s08">A GLIMPSE OF PROMISED LAND</span></h2>

<p>"Hello, Grace!"</p>

<p>I was passing the society editor in her
den a moment later, and she called out a cheery
greeting, although she didn't look up from her
task. She was polishing her finger-nails as busily
as if she lived for her hands&mdash;not by them.</p>

<p>"Hello, Jane!"</p>

<p>My very voice was out of alignment, however,
as I spoke.</p>

<p>"Are you going to let all the world see that
you're not a headstrong woman?" something inside
my pride asked angrily, but as if for corroboration
of my conscientious whisperings, I
looked in a shamefaced way at the lines of my
palm.&mdash;The head-line <i>was</i> weak and isolated&mdash;while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
the heart-line was as crisscrossed as a centipede
track!</p>

<p>But a heart-line has nothing at all to do with a
city editor's desk&mdash;certainly not on a day when
the crumpled balls of copy paper lying about his
waste-basket look as if a woman had thrown
them! Every one had missed its mark, and up
and down the length of the room the typewriters
were clicking falsetto notes. The files of papers
on the table were in as much confusion as patterns
for heathen petticoats at a missionary
meeting.</p>

<p>"What's up?"</p>

<p>I had made my way to the desk of the sporting
editor, who writes poetry and pretends he's so
aerial that he never knows what day of the week
it is, but when you pin him down he can tell you
exactly what you want to know&mdash;from the color
of the bride's going-away gown to the amount
the bridegroom borrowed on his life insurance
policy.</p>

<p>"Search me!" he answered&mdash;as usual.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span></p>

<p>"But there's something going on in this office!"
I insisted. "Everybody looks as exercised as if
the baby'd just swallowed a moth-ball."</p>

<p>"Huh?"</p>

<p>He looked around&mdash;then opened his eyes wider.
"Oh, I believe I did hear 'em say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"That they can't get hold of that story about
the Consolidated Traction Company."</p>

<p>"&mdash;And damn those foreigners who come over
here with their fool notions of dignity!" broke in
the voice of the city editor&mdash;then stopped and
blushed when he saw me within ear-shot, for it's
a rule of the office that no one shall say "damn"
without blushing, except the society editor and
her assistants.</p>

<p>"Who's the foreigner?" I asked, for the sake
of warding off apologies. That's why men object
so strongly to women mixing up with them
in business life. It keeps them eternally apologizing.</p>

<p>"Maitland Tait," he replied.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span></p>

<p>"Maitland Tait? But that's not foreign.
That's perfectly good English."</p>

<p>"So's he!" the city editor snapped. "It's his
confounded John Bullishness that's causing all
the trouble."</p>

<p>"But the traction company's no kin to us, is
it?" the poet inquired crossly, for he was reporting
a double-header in verse, and our chatter annoyed
him.</p>

<p>"Trouble will be kin to us&mdash;if somebody
doesn't break in on Great Britain and make him
cough up the story," the city editor warned over
his shoulder. "I've already sent Clemons and
Bolton and Reade."</p>

<p>"&mdash;And it would mean a raise," the poet said,
with a tender little smile. "A raise!"</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" I asked, after the superior
officer had disappeared. "I'd like&mdash;a raise."</p>

<p>He looked at me contemptuously.</p>

<p>"You don't know what the Consolidated Traction
Company is, I suppose?" he asked.</p>

<p>My business on the paper was reporting art
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
meetings at the Carnegie Library and donation
affairs at settlement homes because the owner
and publisher drank out of the same canteen with
my grandfather&mdash;and my fellows on the staff
called me behind my back their ornamental member.</p>

<p>"I do!" I bristled. "It's located at a greasy
place, called Loomis&mdash;and it's something that
makes the wheels go round."</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"It certainly does in Oldburgh," he said. "It's
the biggest thing we have, next to our own cotton
mills and to think that they're threatening to take
their doll-rags and move to Birmingham and leave
us desolate!"</p>

<p>"Where the iron would be nearer?" I asked,
and he fairly beamed.</p>

<p><i>"Sure!</i> Say, if you know that much about the
company's affairs, why don't you try for this assignment
yourself?"</p>

<p>But I shook my head.</p>

<p>"I've got relatives in Alabama&mdash;that's how I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
knew that iron grows on trees down there," I
explained.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;that's what the trouble is about! Oldburgh
can't tell whether this fellow, Maitland
Tait, is going to pack the 'whole blarsted thing,
don't you know, into his portmanteau' and tote it
off&mdash;or buy up more ground here and enlarge the
plant so that the company's grandchildren will
call this place home."</p>

<p>I turned away, feeling very indifferent. Oldburgh's
problem was small compared with that
letter in my hand-bag.</p>

<p>"And he won't tell?" I asked, crossing over to
my own desk and fitting the key in a slipshod
fashion.</p>

<p>"He seems to think that silence is the divine
right of corporations. Nobody has been able to
get a word out of him&mdash;nor even to see him."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;they don't know whether he's a human
being or a Cockney?"</p>

<p>He leaned across toward me, his elbow flattening
two tiers of keys on his machine.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>

<p>"Say, the society's column's having fever and
ague, too," he whispered. "The tale records that
two of our 'acknowledged leaders' met him in
Pittsburgh last winter&mdash;and they're at daggers'
points now for the privilege of killing the fatted
calf for him.&mdash;The one that does it first is IT, of
course, and Jane Lassiter's scared to death! The
calf is fat and the knife is sharp&mdash;but no report
of the killing has come in."</p>

<p>I laughed. It always makes me laugh when I
think how hard some people work to get rid of
their fatted calves, and how much harder others
have to labor to acquire a veal cutlet.</p>

<p>"Of course he was born in a cabin?" I turned
back to the poet and asked, after a little while
devoted to my own work, in which I learned that
my mind wouldn't concentrate sufficiently for me
to embroider my story of an embryo Michaelangelo
the Carnegie Art Club had just discovered.
"A cabin in the Cornish hills&mdash;don't you know?"</p>

<p>The sporting editor pulled himself viciously
away from his typewriter.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span></p>

<p>"Ty Cobb&mdash;Dry sob&mdash;By mob&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I beg your pardon!"</p>

<p>"Can't you see when a poem is about to die
a-borning?" he asked furiously.</p>

<p>"I am sorry&mdash;and perhaps I might help you a
little," I suggested with becoming meekness.
"How's this?&mdash;High job&mdash;Nigh rob&mdash;"</p>

<p>I paused and he began writing hurriedly.
Looking up again he threw me a smile.</p>

<p>"Bully! Grace Christie, you're the light o' my
life," he announced, "and&mdash;and of course that
blamed Englishman was born in a cabin, if that's
what you want to know."</p>

<p>"It's not that I care, but&mdash;they always are," I
explained. "They're born in a cabin, come across
in the steerage amid terrific storms&mdash;Why is it
that everybody's story of steerage crossing is
stormy?&mdash;It seems to me it would be bad enough
without that&mdash;then he sold papers for two years
beneath the cart-wheels around the Battery, and
by sheer strength of brain and brawn, has elevated
himself into the proud privilege of being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
able to die in a 'carstle' when it suits his convenience."</p>

<p>The sporting editor looked solicitous.</p>

<p>"And now, if I were you, to keep from wearing
myself out with talking, I'd get on the car and
ride out to Glendale Park," he advised.</p>

<p>But I shook my head.</p>

<p>"I can't."</p>

<p>"You really owe it to yourself," he insisted.
"You are showing symptoms of a strange excitement
to-day. You look as if you were talking to
keep from doing something more annoying&mdash;if
such a thing were possible."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to weep&mdash;either from excitement
or the effects of your rudeness," I returned,
then wheeling around and facing my desk again
I let my dual personality take up its song.</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"I can and I can't;</p>
<p>I will and I won't;</p>
<p>I'll be damned if I do&mdash;</p>
<p>I'll be damned if I don't!"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span></p>

<p>The story goes that a queen of Sweden composed
this classic many years ago, but it's certainly
the national song of every one who has
two people living in his skin that are not on
speaking terms with each other.</p>

<p>Then, partly to keep from annoying the poet
again, partly because it's the thing a woman always
does, I took out the letter and read it over
once more.</p>

<p>"Coburn-Colt&mdash;Philadelphia!"</p>

<p>The paper was a creamy satin, the embossing
severely correct, the typing so neat and businesslike
that I could scarcely believe the letter
was meant for me when I looked at the outside
only.</p>

<p>"Wonder what 'Julien J. Dutweiler' would
call a small fortune?" I muttered. "Five thousand
dollars? Ten thousand dollars!&mdash;Good
heavens, then mother could have all the crepe
meteor gowns she wanted without my ever&mdash;<i>ever</i>
having to marry Guilford Blake for her
sake!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span></p>

<p>But as I sat there thinking, grandfather took
up the cudgels bravely&mdash;even though the people
most concerned were Christies and not Moores.</p>

<p>"Think well, Grace! That 'best-selling' clause
means not only Maine to California, but England,
Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Berwick-on-the-Tweed!"
he warned. "Everybody who had ever
heard of either of these two unfortunate people
will buy a copy of the book and read it to find out
what really happened!"</p>

<p>"But the letters are hers!" Uncle Lancelot reminded
him. "If people don't want posterity to
know the truth about them they ought to confine
themselves to wireless communications."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;what would your Aunt Patricia say?"
grandfather kept on. "What would James
Christie say? What would Lady Frances Webb
say?"</p>

<p>Thinking is certainly a bad habit&mdash;especially
when your time belongs to somebody else and
you are not being paid to think! Nevertheless, I
sat there all the afternoon, puzzling my brain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
when my brain was not supposed to wake up and
rub its eyes at all inside the <i>Herald</i> office. I was
being paid to come there and write airy little
nothings for the <i>Herald's</i> airy little readers, yet
I added to my sin of indecision by absorbing time
which wasn't mine.</p>

<p>"Of course the possession of these letters in a
way connects you with greatness," grandfather
would say once in a while, in a lenient, musing
sort of way. "But I trust that you are not going
to let this fly to your head. Anyway, as the family
has always known, your Uncle James Christie
didn't leave his letters and papers to his great-niece;
he merely <i>left</i> them! True, she was very
close to him in his last days and he had always
loved and trusted her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But there's a difference between trusting a
woman and trusting her <i>with your desk keys</i>!"
Uncle Lancelot interrupted. "Uncle James ought
to have known a thing or two about women by
that time!"</p>

<p>"Yet we must realize that the value of the possession
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
was considerable, even in those days,"
grandfather argued gently. "We must not blame
his great-niece for what she did. James Mackenzie
Christie had caught the whole fashionable
world on the tip of his camel's-hair brush and
pinioned it to canvases which were destined to
get double-starred notices in guide-books for
many a year to come, and the correspondence of
kings and queens, lords and ladies made a mighty
appeal to the young girl's mind."</p>

<p>"Then, that's a sure sign they'd be popular
once again," said Uncle Lancelot. "Of course
there's a degree of family pride to be considered,
but that shouldn't make much difference. The
Christies have always had pride to spare&mdash;now's
the time to let some of it slide!"</p>

<p>Thus, after hours of time and miles of circling
tentatively around the battlements of Colmere
Abbey&mdash;the beautiful old place which had been
the home of Lady Frances Webb&mdash;I was called
back with a stern suddenness to my place in the
<i>Herald</i> office.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<p>"Can <i>you</i> think of anything else?" the poet's
voice begged humbly. "I'm trying to match up
just plain 'Ty' this time&mdash;but I'm dry."</p>

<p>I turned to him forgivingly. I welcomed any
diversion.</p>

<p>"Rye, lie, die, sky,&mdash;why, what's the matter
with your think tank?" I asked him. "They
swarm!"</p>

<p>But before he could thank me, or apologize,
the voice of the city editor was in the doorway.
He himself followed his rasping tones, and as he
came in he looked backward over his shoulder at
a forlorn dejected face outside. He looked at his
watch viciously, then snapped the case as if it
were responsible for his spleen.</p>

<p>"Get to work then on something else," he
growled. "There's no use spending car fare
again to Loomis to-day that I can see! He's an
Englishman&mdash;and of course he kisses a teacup at
this time of the afternoon."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="s08">NIP AND TUCK</span></h2>

<p>When I reached home late that afternoon I
was in that state of spring-time restlessness
which clamors for immediate activity&mdash;when
the home-keeping instinct tries to make you believe
that you'll be content if you spend a little
money for garden seeds&mdash;but a reckless demon of
extravagance notifies you that nothing short of
salary sacrificed for railroad fare is going to avail.</p>

<p>Grandfather and Uncle Lancelot, of course,
came in with their gratuitous advice, the one suggesting
nasturtium beds with geraniums along the
borders&mdash;the other slyly whispering that a boat
trip from Savannah to Boston was no more than
I deserved.</p>

<p>Then, reaching home in this frame of mind, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
was confronted with two very perplexing and
unusual conditions. <i>Mignon</i> was being played
with great violence in the front parlor&mdash;and all
over the house was the scent of burnt yarn.</p>

<p>"What's up?" I demanded of mother, as she
met me at the door&mdash;dressed in blue. "Everything
seems mysterious and topsyturvy to-day!
I believe if I were to go out to the cemetery I'd
find the tombstones nodding and whispering to
one another."</p>

<p>"Come in here!" she begged in a Santa Claus
voice.</p>

<p>I went into the parlor, then gave a little shriek.</p>

<p>"Mother!"</p>

<p>I have neglected to state, earlier in the narrative,
that the one desire of my heart which doesn't
begin with H was a player-piano! It was there in
the parlor, at that moment, shining, and singing
its wordless song about the citron-flower land.</p>

<p>"It's the very one we've been <i>watching</i> through
the windows up-town," she said in a delighted
whisper.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span></p>

<p>"But did you get it as a prize?" I inquired,
walking into the dusky room and shaking hands
with my betrothed, who rose from the instrument
and made way for me to take possession. "How
came it here?"</p>

<p>"I had it sent out&mdash;on&mdash;on approval," she
elucidated. That is, her words took the form of
an explanation, but her voice was as appealing as
a Salvation Army dinner-bell, just before Christmas.</p>

<p>"On approval? But why, please?"</p>

<p>"Because I want you to get used to having the
things you want, darling!"</p>

<p>Then, to keep from laughing&mdash;or crying&mdash;I
ran toward the door.</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> that burning?" I asked, sniffing suspiciously.</p>

<p>It was a vaguely familiar scent&mdash;scorching
dress-goods&mdash;and suggestive of the awful feeling
which comes to you when you've stood too close
to the fire in your best coat-suit&mdash;or the comfortable
sensation on a cold night, when you're
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
preparing to wrap up your feet in a red-hot flannel
petticoat.</p>

<p>"What is it? Tell the truth, mother!"</p>

<p>But she wouldn't.</p>

<p>"It's your brown tweed skirt, Grace," Guilford
finally explained, as my eyes begged the secret
of them both. They frequently had secrets from
me.</p>

<p>"My brown tweed skirt?"</p>

<p>"It was as baggy at the knees as if you'd done
nothing all winter but <i>pray</i> in it!" mother whimpered
in a frightened voice. "I've&mdash;I've burned
it up!"</p>

<p>For a moment I was silent.</p>

<p>"But what shall I tramp in?" I finally asked
severely. "What can I walk out the Waverley
Pike in?"</p>

<p>Then mother took fresh courage.</p>

<p>"You're not going to walk!" she answered
triumphantly. "You're going to ride&mdash;in your
very&mdash;own&mdash;electric&mdash;coupé! Here's the catalogue."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span></p>

<p>She scrambled about for a book on a table
near at hand&mdash;and I began to see daylight.</p>

<p>"Oh, a player-piano, and an electric coupé&mdash;all
in one day! I see! My fairy godmother&mdash;who
was old Aunt Patricia, and she looked exactly
like one&mdash;has turned the pumpkin into a
gold coach! You two plotters have been putting
your heads together to have me get rich quick
and gracefully!"</p>

<p>"We understand that this stroke of fortune is
going to make a great change in your life, Grace,"
Guilford said gravely. He was always grave&mdash;and
old. The only way you could tell his demeanor
from that of a septuagenarian was that
he didn't drag his feet as he walked.</p>

<p>"'Stroke of fortune?'" I repeated.</p>

<p>"The Coburn&mdash;" mother began.</p>

<p>"Colt&mdash;" he re-enforced, then they both hesitated,
and looked at me meaningly.</p>

<p>I gave a hysterical laugh.</p>

<p>"You and mother have counted your Coburn-Colts
before they were hatched!" I exclaimed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
wickedly, sitting down and looking over the music
rolls. I did want that player-piano tremendously&mdash;although
I had about as much use for an electric
coupé, under my present conditions in life, as
I had for a perambulator.</p>

<p>"Grace, you're&mdash;indelicate!" mother said, her
voice trembling. "Guilford's a man!"</p>

<p>"A man's a man&mdash;especially a Kentuckian!" I
answered. "You're not shocked at my mention
of colts and&mdash;and things, are you, Guilford?"</p>

<p>My betrothed sat down and lifted from the
bridge of his nose that badge of civilization&mdash;a
pair of rimless glasses. He polished them with
a dazzling handkerchief, then replaced the handkerchief
into the pocket of the most faultless coat
ever seen. He smoothed his already well-disciplined
hair, and brushed away a speck of dust
from the toe of his shoe. From head to foot he
fairly bristled with signs of civic improvement.</p>

<p>"I am shocked at your reception of your
mother's kind thoughtfulness," he said.</p>

<p>He waited a little while before saying it, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
hesitation was his way of showing disapproval.
Yet you must not get the impression from this
that Guilford was a bad sort! Why, no woman
could ride in an elevator with him for half a
minute without realizing that he was the flower-of-chivalry
sort of man! He always had a little
way of standing back from a woman, as if she
were too sacred to be approached, and in her presence
he had a habit of holding his hat clasped
firmly against the buttons of his coat. You can
forgive a good deal in a man if he keeps his hat
off all the time he's talking to you!</p>

<p>"'Shocked?'" I repeated.</p>

<p>"Your mother always plans for your happiness,
Grace."</p>

<p>"Of course! Don't you suppose I know that?"
I immediately asked in an injured tone. It is always
safe to assume an injured air when you're
arguing with a man, for it gives him quite as
much pleasure to comfort you as it does to hurt
you.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>

<p>"I didn't&mdash;mean anything!" he hastened to assure
me.</p>

<p>"Guilford merely jumped at the chance of
your freeing yourself of this newspaper slavery,"
mother interceded. "You know what a humiliation
it is to him&mdash;just as it is to me and to every
member of the&mdash;Christie family."</p>

<p>My betrothed nodded so violently in acquiescence
that his glasses flew off in space.</p>

<p>"You know that I am a Kentuckian in my way
of regarding women, Grace," he plead. "I can't
bear to see them step down from the pedestal that
nature ordained for them!"</p>

<p>I turned and looked him over&mdash;from the crown
of his intensely aristocratic fair head to the tip of
his aristocratic slim foot.</p>

<p>"A Kentuckian?"</p>

<p>"Certainly!"</p>

<p>"A Kentuckian?" I repeated reminiscently.
"Why, Guilford Blake, you ought to be olive-skinned&mdash;and
black-eyed&mdash;and your shoes ought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
to turn up at the toes&mdash;and your head ought to be
covered by a red fez&mdash;and you ought to sit smoking
through a water-bottle of an evening, in front
of your&mdash;your&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Grace!" stormed mother, rising suddenly to
her feet. "I will not have you say such things!"</p>

<p>"What things?" I asked, drawing back in hurt
surprise.</p>

<p>"H-harems!" she uttered in a blushing whisper,
but Guilford caught the word and squared
his shoulders importantly.</p>

<p>"But, I say, Grace," he interrupted, his face
showing that mixture of anger and pleased vanity
which a man always shows when you tell him
that he's a dangerous tyrant, or a bold Don Juan&mdash;or
both. "You don't think I'm a Turk&mdash;do
you?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>He sighed wistfully.</p>

<p>"If I were," he said, shaking his head, "I'd
have caught you&mdash;and <i>veiled</i> you&mdash;long before
this."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span></p>

<p>I looked at him intently.</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That I shouldn't have let you delay our marriage
this way! Why should you, pray, when
my financial affairs have changed so in the last
year?"</p>

<p>I rose from my place beside the new piano,
breaking gently into his plea.</p>

<p>"It isn't that!" I attempted to explain, but my
voice failed drearily. "You ought to know that&mdash;finances
hadn't anything to do with it. I
haven't kept from marrying you all these years
because we were both so poor&mdash;then, last year
when you inherited your money&mdash;I didn't keep
from marrying you because you were so rich!"</p>

<p>"Then, what is it?" he asked gravely, and
mother looked on as eagerly for my answer as he
did. This is one advantage about a life-long betrothal.
It gets to be a family institution. Or
is that a disadvantage?</p>

<p>"I&mdash;don't know," I confessed, settling back
weakly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't think you do!" mother observed with
considerable dryness.</p>

<p>"Well, this business of your getting to be a
famous compiler of literature may help you get
your bearings," Guilford kept on, after an awkward
little pause. "You have always said that
you wished to exercise your own wings a little
before we married, and I have given in to you&mdash;although
I don't know that it's right to humor a
woman in these days and times. Really, I don't
know that it is."</p>

<p>"Oh, you don't?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I don't. But we're not discussing that
now, Grace! What I'm trying to get at is that
this offer means a good deal to you. Of course,
it is only the beginning of your career&mdash;for these
fellows will think up other things for you to do&mdash;and
it will give you a way of earning money that
won't take you up a flight of dirty office stairs
every day. Understand, I mean for just a short
while&mdash;as long as you insist upon earning your
own living."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<p>"And the honor!" mother added. "You could
have your pictures in good magazines!"</p>

<p>I stifled a yawn, for, to tell the truth, the conflict
had made me nervous and weary.</p>

<p>"At all events, I must decide!" I exclaimed,
starting again to my feet. "Somehow, the office
atmosphere isn't exactly conducive to deep
thought&mdash;and I've had so little time since morning
to get away by myself and thresh matters
out."</p>

<p>Mother looked at me incredulously.</p>

<p>"Will you please tell me just what you mean,
Grace?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I mean that I must get away&mdash;I've imagined
that I ought to take some serious thought, weigh
the matter well, so to speak&mdash;before I write to the
Coburn-Colt Publishing Company. In other
words, I have to decide."</p>

<p>"Decide?" mother repeated, her face filled with
piteous amazement. "<i>Decide?</i>"</p>

<p>"Decide?" Guilford said, taking up the strain
complainingly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span></p>

<p>"If you'll excuse me!" I answered, starting toward
the door, then turning with an effort at
nonchalance, for their sakes, to wave them a little
adieu. "Suppose you keep on playing 'Knowest
thou the land where the citron-flower blooms,'
Guilford&mdash;for I am filled with <i>wanderlust</i> right
now, and this music will help out Uncle Lancelot's
presentation of the matter considerably!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to listen to the voices," I explained.
"All day long grandfather and Uncle Lancelot
have been busy making the fur fly in my conscience!"</p>

<p>Mother darted across the room and caught my
hand.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say that you have scruples&mdash;<i>scruples</i>&mdash;Grace
Christie?"</p>

<p>She couldn't have hated smallpox worse&mdash;in
me.</p>

<p>"Honest Injun, I don't know!" I admitted.
"Of course, it does seem absurd to ponder over
what a family row might be raised in the Seventh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
Circle of Nirvana by the publication of these
old love-letters, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"James Mackenzie Christie died in 1849," she
declared vehemently. "Absurd! It is <i>insane</i>!"</p>

<p>"That's what the Uncle Lancelot part of my intelligence
keeps telling me," I laughed. "But&mdash;good
heavens! you just ought to hear the grandfather
argument."</p>

<p>"What does he&mdash;what does that silly <i>Salem</i>
conscience of yours say against the publication of
the letters?" she asked grudgingly.</p>

<p>I sat down again.</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you?" I began good-naturedly, for
I saw that mother was at the melting point&mdash;melting
into tears, however, not assent. "Whenever
I want to do anything I'm not exactly <i>sure</i> of,
these two provoking old gentlemen come into the
room&mdash;the council-chamber of my heart&mdash;and
begin their post-mortem warfare. Grandfather
is white-bearded and serene, while Uncle Lancelot
looks exactly as an Italian tenor <i>ought</i> to look&mdash;and
never does."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span></p>

<p>"And you look exactly like him," mother
snapped viciously. "Nothing about you resembles
your grandfather except your brow and eyes."</p>

<p>"I know that," I answered resignedly. "Hasn't
some one said that the upper part of my face is as
lofty as a Byronic thought&mdash;and the lower as
devilish as a Byronic <i>deed</i>?"</p>

<p>Neither of them smiled, but Guilford stirred a
little.</p>

<p>"Go on with your argument, Grace," he urged
patiently. He was always patient.</p>

<p>"I'm going!" I answered. "All day grandfather
has been telling me what I already know&mdash;that
the Coburn-Colt Company doesn't want
those letters of James Christie's because they are
literary, or beautiful, or historical, but simply
and solely because they are <i>bad</i>! They'll make a
good-seller because they're the thing the public
demands right now. Lady Frances Webb was a
<i>married</i> woman!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense," mother interrupted, with a blush.
"The public doesn't demand bad things! There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
is merely a craze for intimate, biographical matter&mdash;told
in the first person."</p>

<p>"I know," I admitted humbly. "This is what
distinguishes a human from an inhuman document."</p>

<p>"The craze demands a simple straightforward
narrative&mdash;" Guilford began, then hesitated.</p>

<p>"In literature this is the period of the great '<i>I
Am</i>,'" I broke in. "People want the secrets of a
writer's soul, rather than the tricks of his vocabulary,
I know."</p>

<p>"Well, good lord&mdash;you wouldn't be giving the
twentieth century any more of these people's souls
than they themselves gave to the early nineteenth,"
he argued scornfully. "She put his portrait
into every book she ever wrote&mdash;and he annexed
her face in the figure of every saint&mdash;and
sinner&mdash;he painted!"</p>

<p>"Well, that was because they couldn't <i>see</i> any
other faces," I defended.</p>

<p>"Bosh!"</p>

<p>"But Lady Frances Webb was a good woman,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
mother insisted weakly. "She had pre-Victorian
ideas! She sent her lover across seas, because
she felt that she must! Why, the publication of
these letters would do <i>good</i>, not harm."</p>

<p>"They would shame the present-day idea of
'affinity' right," said Guilford.</p>

<p>I nodded my head, for this was the same
theory that Uncle Lancelot had been whispering
in my ears since the postman blew his whistle that
morning. And yet&mdash;</p>

<p>"Maybe you two&mdash;don't exactly understand
the import of those letters as I do," I suggested,
sorry and ashamed before the gaze of their practical
eyes. "But to me they mean so much! I
have always <i>loved</i> James Christie and&mdash;his Unattainable.
I can feel for them, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you mean to say that you are going to
give way to an absurd fancy now&mdash;a ridiculous,
far-fetched, namby-pamby, quixotic fancy?"
mother asked, in a tone of horror.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'm&mdash;afraid so!" I stammered.</p>

<p>"And miss this chance&mdash;for all the things you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
want most? The very things you're toiling day
and night to get?"</p>

<p>"And put off the prospect of our marriage?"
Guilford demanded. "I had hoped that this
business transaction would satisfy the unaccountable
desire you seem to have for independence&mdash;that
after you had circled about a little in the
realm of emancipated women and their strained
notions of what constitutes freedom, you'd see
the absurdity of it all and&mdash;come to me."</p>

<p>"I am awfully sorry, Guilford," I answered,
dropping my eyes, for I knew that "freedom,"
"independence" and "emancipation" had nothing
on earth to do with my delayed marriage&mdash;and
I knew that I was doing wrong not to say so.
"I am <i>awfully</i> sorry to disappoint you."</p>

<p>"Then you have decided finally?" mother
asked in a suspicious voice.</p>

<p>"I believe I have," I answered. "Oh, please
don't look at me that way&mdash;and please don't cry!
I can't help it!"</p>

<p>"It is preposterous," Guilford said shortly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span></p>

<p>"But you don't&mdash;understand!" I cried, turning
to him pleadingly. "You don't know what it is
to feel as I feel about those lovers&mdash;those people
who had no happiness in this world&mdash;and are
haunted and tormented by curiosity in their very
graves!&mdash;don't you suppose I want to do the
thing you and mother want me to do? Of
course, I do! I want this&mdash;this new piano&mdash;and
another brown tweed skirt that doesn't bag at the
knees&mdash;and I want&mdash;so many things!"</p>

<p>"Then why in the name of&mdash;&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"Because I <i>won't</i>!" I told him flatly. "Call it
conscience&mdash;fancy, or what you will!&mdash;I have
those two people in my power&mdash;their secrets are
right here in my hands! And I'm not going to
<i>give them away</i>!"</p>

<p>"Grace, you a-maze me!" mother sobbed.</p>

<p>But Guilford rose tranquilly and reached for
his hat.</p>

<p>"Any woman who has a conscience like that
ought to cauterize it&mdash;with a curling-iron&mdash;and
get rid of it," he observed dryly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="s08">THE QUALITY OF MERCY</span></h2>

<p>That night I went to my bedroom and pulled
open the top of an old-fashioned desk standing
in the corner. Except for this desk there was
not another unnecessary piece of furniture in the
apartment, for I like a cell-like place to sleep. I
consider that fresh air and a clear conscience
ought to be the chief adjuncts&mdash;for a cluttered-up,
luxurious bedroom always reminds me of
Camille&mdash;and tuberculosis.</p>

<p>"And all this fuss about a few little faded
wisps of paper!"</p>

<p>I sat down before the desk, after I had loosed
my hair&mdash;which is that very, very black, that is
the Hibernian accompaniment to blue eyes&mdash;and
had slipped my slippers on.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span></p>

<p>"You have put me to considerable trouble to-day,
Lady Frances."</p>

<p>Her portrait was hanging there&mdash;a small,
cabinet-sized picture, in a battered gold frame.
Her lover had succeeded in making her face on
canvas very beautiful&mdash;with the exaggerated
beauty of eyes and mouth which all portraits of
that period show. Her brow was fine and
thoughtful, irradiating the face with intelligence,
yet I never looked at her without having a feeling
that I was infinitely wiser than she.</p>

<p>Isn't it queer that we have this feeling of
superiority over the people in old portraits&mdash;just
because they are dead and we are living? We
open an ancient book of engravings, and say:
"Poor little Mary Shelley! Simple little Jane
Austen! Naughty little Nell Gwynne!"&mdash;There's
only one pictured lady of my acquaintance who
smiles down my latter-day wisdom as being a
futile upstart thing. I can't pity her! Oh, no!
Nor endure her either, for she's Mona Lisa!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<p>I had always had this maternal protectiveness
in my attitude toward Lady Frances Webb, and
to-night it was so keen that I could have tucked
her in bed and told her fairy tales to soothe away
the trembling fright she must have endured all
that day. Instead of doing this, however, I
satisfied myself with reading some of the letters
over again. Isn't it a pity that above every writing-desk
devoted to inter-sex correspondence
there is not a framed warning: "Beyond
Platonic Friendship Lies&mdash;Alimony!"</p>

<p>Anyway, Lady Frances and James Christie
tried the medium ground for a while. Over in a
large pigeonhole, far away from the rest, was a
packet of letters tied with a strong twine. They
were the uninteresting ones, because they were
<i>muzzled</i>. The handwriting was the same as that
of the others&mdash;dainty, last-century chirography,
as delicate and curling as a baby's pink fingers&mdash;but
I never read them, for I don't care for muzzled
things. Gossip about Lady Jersey&mdash;Marlborough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
House&mdash;the cold-blooded ire of William
Lamb&mdash;all this held but little charm&mdash;compared
with the other.</p>

<p>"Not you&mdash;not to-night," I decided, pushing
them aside quickly. "I've got to have good pay
for my pains of this day!"</p>

<p>I sought another compartment, where a batch
huddled together&mdash;a carefully selected batch.
They were as many, and as clinging in their contact
with one another, as early kisses. I took
up the first one.</p>

<p>"Dear Big Man"&mdash;it began.</p>

<p>"It has been weeks and weeks now since I have
seen you! If it were not that you lived in that
terrible London and I in this lonely country, I
should be too proud to remind you of the time,
for I should expect you to be the one to complain.</p>

<p>"Surely it is because of this that I now hate
London so! It keeps this knowledge of separation&mdash;this
sense of dreary waiting&mdash;from burning
into your heart, as it does into mine!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span></p>

<p>"There you are kept too busy to think&mdash;but here
I can do nothing else!&mdash;Or perhaps I am quite
wrong, and it is not a matter of London and
Lancashire, after all, but the more primal one of
your being a man, and my being a woman! <i>Do</i>
I love the more? I wonder? And yet, I don't
think that I care much! I am willing to love
more abjectly than any woman ever loved before&mdash;if
you care for me just a little in return."</p>

<p>(I always felt <i>very</i> wise and maternal at this
point.)</p>

<p>"You were an awful goose, Lady Frances!" I
said. "This is a mistake that <i>I</i> have never
made!"</p>

<p>"Still, I am tormented by thoughts of you in
London," the letter kept on. "I think of you&mdash;there&mdash;as
a lion. It presses down upon me, this
recollection that you are James Christie, the great
artist, and the only release from the torture is
when I go alone into the library and sit down
before the fire. The two chairs are there&mdash;those
two that were there that day&mdash;and then I can forget
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
about the lion. 'Jim&mdash;Jim!' I whisper&mdash;'just
my <i>lover</i>!'</p>

<p>"Then your face comes&mdash;it has to come, or I
could never be good! Your rugged face that
speaks of great forests which have been your
home&mdash;the fierce young freedom which has nurtured
you&mdash;and the glorious uplift you have
achieved above all that is small and weak!</p>

<p>"You have asked me a thousand times why I
love you, but I have never known what to say&mdash;because
I love you for so many things&mdash;until
now, when I have nothing but memories&mdash;and
the ever-present sight of your absent face. And
now I don't know why I love you, but I know
what I love best about you. Shall I tell you&mdash;though
of course you know already! It is not
your talent&mdash;wonderful as it is&mdash;for there have
been other artists; nor your terrible charm with
its power to lure women away from duty&mdash;for
England is full of fascinating men; nor your
sweetness&mdash;and I think the first time I saw you
smile I sounded the depths of this&mdash;it is not any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
of these, dear heart! Not any of these! I love
best the strength of you which you use to control
the charm&mdash;the untamed force of your personality
which makes your talent seem just an incident&mdash;and
the big, <i>big</i> virility of you!</p>

<p>"Do you think for a moment that you look like
an artist? Half-civilized you? Why, you are a
woodsman, dear love&mdash;but not a hunter! You
could never kill living things for the joy of seeing
them die!</p>

<p>"You look as if you had spent all your life in
the woods, doing hard tasks patiently&mdash;a woodcutter,
or a charcoal burner! Ah, a charcoal
burner! A man who has had to grip life with
bared hands and wrest his bread from grudging
circumstances. This is what you are, Jim, to my
heart's eyes. You are a primal creature&mdash;simple-souled,
great-bodied, and your mind is given over
to naked truth.</p>

<p>"But all the time you are a famous artist&mdash;and
London's idol! Your studio in St. James's
Street is the lounging-place for curled darlings!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
The hardest task that your hands perform is over
the ugly features of a fat duchess!&mdash;How can
you, Jim? Why don't you come away? You
are a man first, an artist afterward&mdash;and it is the
man that I love!</p>

<p>"And, Jim, <i>do</i> you know how much I love you?
Do you know how your face leads me on?&mdash;It is
your face I must have now, darling. <i>Portrait
of the Artist, by Himself</i>, is a title I have often
smiled over, wondering how a man could be induced
to paint his own features, but now I know!
It is always because some woman has so clamorously
demanded it&mdash;a woman who loved him!
What else can so entirely satisfy&mdash;and when will
you send it to me?"</p>

<p>When I came to the end I was sorry, for I had
such a way of getting en rapport with her sentiments
that I eyed the next express wagon I
passed, eagerly, to see if it could possibly be
bringing the <i>Portrait of the Artist, by Himself</i>!</p>

<p>And on this occasion I reread a portion of the
letter.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span></p>

<p>"Your face&mdash;your rugged face&mdash;or I could
never be good!"</p>

<p>The picture of a rugged face was haunting me,
and after a moment a sudden thought came to
me.</p>

<p>"Why, that's what <i>I</i> should like!"</p>

<p>I had the grace to feel ashamed, of course,
especially as I recalled how mother and Guilford
had tormented me that afternoon to know why I
wouldn't marry&mdash;and I found the answer in this
sudden discovery. Still, that didn't keep me from
pursuing the subject.</p>

<p>"A rugged face&mdash;great forests&mdash;fierce freedom&mdash;glorious
uplift!&mdash;Oh, Man! Man! Where are
you&mdash;and where is your great forest?&mdash;That's
exactly what I want!"</p>

<p>I turned back to the desk, after a while, and
still allowing my mind to circle away from the
business at hand somewhat, I drew out another
letter. It was short&mdash;and troubled. The dear,
little, lady-like writing ran off at a tangent.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have seen the picture! Next to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Murillo's <i>Betrothal of St. Catherine</i>,&mdash;the face is
the loveliest thing I have ever seen on canvas.</p>

<p>"Of course it is idealized&mdash;yet so absurdly <i>like</i>
that they tell me all Mayfair is staring! This
talk&mdash;this stirring-up of what has been sleeping&mdash;will
make it a thousand times harder for us
ever to see each other, yet I am glad you did it!</p>

<p>"They are saying&mdash;Mayfair&mdash;that your
'making a pageant of a bleeding heart' is as indelicate
as Caroline Lamb's <i>Glenarvon</i>! If people
are going to be in love wickedly at least they
ought not to write books about it&mdash;nor paint pictures
of it!... Oh, beloved, let us pray
that we may always keep bitterness out of our
portraits of each other!"</p>

<p>The letter burned my fingers, for the pen
marks were quick and jagged&mdash;like electric sparks&mdash;and
I felt the pain that had sent them out; so
I turned back to others of the batch&mdash;others that
I knew almost by heart, yet always found something
new in.</p>

<p>"I don't know that it's such an enviable state,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
after all, this being in love," I mused. "It seems
to me it consists of&mdash;quite a mixture! But, of
course, it will take Heaven itself to solve the
problem of a thornless rose!"</p>

<p>I ran my finger over the edges of the improvised
envelopes, heavily sealed and bearing complicated
foreign stamping. There were dozens
of them&mdash;many only the common garden variety
of love-letters, long-drawn out, confidential,
reminiscent or hopeful, as the case might be&mdash;and
a few which sounded at times almost light-hearted.</p>

<p>"When I say that I think of you all the time
I am not so original as my critics give me credit
for being, dear heart," she wrote in one. "Nothing
else in the annals of love-making is so trite
as this, but when I explain how persistently your
image is before me, how intricately woven with
every thought of the future&mdash;how inseparably
linked with every vision of happiness&mdash;you will
know that mine is no light nor passing attachment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span></p>

<p>"If I give you one foolish example of this will
it bore you? I've written you before, I believe,
that this spring I have been outdoors all the time&mdash;riding
or driving about the country, because
the mad restlessness of thinking about you drives
me out. In this house, in these gardens, <i>you</i> are
so constantly present that I can do nothing but
remember&mdash;then I go away, hoping to forget&mdash;and
what happens?&mdash;I go into a castle&mdash;a place
where you have never been, perhaps&mdash;and before
I can begin talking with any one, or think of any
sensible thing to say the thought comes to me:
'How well the figure of my lover would fit in with
all this grandeur! How naturally and easily he
would swing through these great rooms!'</p>

<p>"Then, early some mornings I ride into the
village&mdash;past cottages that look so humble and
happy that I feel my heart stifling with longing
to possess one of them&mdash;and <i>you</i>! 'How happy
I could be living there,' I think, 'but&mdash;how
tremendously tall and stalwart Jim would look
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
coming in through this low doorway, as I called
him to supper!'</p>

<p>"Then I spend hours and hours planning the
real home I want us to have, dear love of mine.
I don't care much whether it is a castle or a cottage,
just so it has you in it&mdash;and all around it
must be the sight of distant hills! These for
<i>your</i> artist's soul!</p>

<p>"You and a hundred distant hills, Jim! Then
days&mdash;and nights, and nights and days&mdash;and
summers and winters of joy!</p>

<p>"Some time this will come to pass&mdash;it must&mdash;and
we shall call it heaven! And we shall rejoice
that we were strong to keep the faith
through the days of trial and longing so that we
could reach it and be worthy of it.</p>

<p>"And, when this shall come, I can never know
fear again&mdash;fear that London will make you
cease to love me&mdash;that some other woman may
gain possession of you&mdash;that the artist in you
may crush out and starve the lover. There will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
be but one thought of fear then, and that will be
that you may die and leave me, but this will not
be hopeless, for I too can die!</p>

<p>"Oh, do you remember that first day&mdash;that
wonderful, anguished, bewildering first day&mdash;then
that night when I kissed you? When I think of
sickening fear I always remember that time.
Two weeks before the London newspapers had
chronicled your visit to Colmere Abbey 'to paint
the portrait of the novelist, Lady Frances Webb,'
but you were deceiving the newspapers, for you
had lost your power to paint!</p>

<p>"It was quite early in the morning of that
eighth or ninth day of blessed dalliance, when the
canvas still showed itself accusingly bare, that you
threw down your brush and declared you were
going back to London, 'because&mdash;because Colmere
Abbey had robbed your hands of their
power.'</p>

<p>"And what did I do when you told me this
terrible thing? I said, wickedly and without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
shame, 'Would you go away and leave me all
alone in idleness?'</p>

<p>"'Idleness?' you repeated, pretending not to
understand.</p>

<p>"'Neither can I do any work&mdash;since you came
to Colmere!'</p>

<p>"You stood quite still beside the easel for a
breathless moment, then:</p>

<p>"'Do <i>I</i>&mdash;keep <i>you</i>&mdash;from working?' you
asked.</p>

<p>"Your face tried to look sorry and amazed, but
the triumph showed through and glorified your
dear eyes.</p>

<p>"'Then certainly I must go away&mdash;at once&mdash;to-day,'
you kept on, but you came straight across
the room and placed your hands upon my
shoulders. 'Just this once&mdash;just one time, sweetheart,
then I'll go straight away and never see
you again!'</p>

<p>"And that night, true to your promise, you did
go away, but I followed you to the gates&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
when I saw horses ready saddled there to take
you away from me, the high resolves I had made
came fluttering to earth. I put my hands up to
your face and kissed you. During all the giddy
joy of that day's confessional I had kept from
doing this, but&mdash;not when I saw you leaving!</p>

<p>"'I wish that this kiss could mark your cheek&mdash;and
let all the world know that you are mine,' I
whispered, shivering against you in that first madness
of fear over losing you.</p>

<p>"'You've made a mark!' you laughed fondly.
'A mark that I shall carry all the days of my life.'</p>

<p>"But I was still fearful.</p>

<p>"'You may know that you are marked, but
how will the world&mdash;how will other women know
that you are mine?'</p>

<p>"'The world shall know it,' you declared,
brushing back my hair and kissing me again.
'There will never be another woman in my life&mdash;and
some day, when I can paint your portrait, it
will certainly know then. To me you are so
very beautiful.'"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span></p>

<p>Another letter was just a note, addressed to
London, and evidently written in great haste to
catch a delayed post-bag.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, that orange tree of ours&mdash;that
you and I planted together that day&mdash;is putting
out tiny blossoms! Do you suppose it is a happy
omen, Jim? How I have worked with it through
this dreary winter&mdash;and now to think that it is
blooming!</p>

<p>"Your dear hands have touched it! It is a
living thing which can receive my caresses and
repay their tenderness by growing tall and strong
and beautiful&mdash;like you. Do you wonder that I
love it?</p>

<p>"When you come again I shall take you out
to see it, and we shall walk softly up to the shelf
where it stands&mdash;so carefully, to keep from
jarring a single leaf&mdash;and we shall separate the
branches, still very carefully, to look down at the
little new stems. And, Jim&mdash;Jim&mdash;the blossoms
will be like starry young eyes looking up at us!
The pink, faintly-showing glow will be as delicate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
as a tiny cheek, when sleep has flushed it&mdash;and
the petals will close over our fingers with all
the clinging softness of a helpless little clutch!</p>

<p>"We will be very happy for a little while, but,
because I am savage and resentful over our delayed
joy, I shall cry on your shoulder and say it's
cruel&mdash;<i>cruel</i>&mdash;that you and I have only this plant
to love together."</p>

<p>After this came two or three more, like it, then
I reached for one which brought a misty wetness
to my eyes. The lover was gone&mdash;quite
gone&mdash;and the woman had seemed to feel that
they would meet no more.</p>

<p>... "At other times I remember all the
months which have gone by since then&mdash;and the
miles of dark water which roll between your
land and mine. God pity the woman who has a
lover across the sea!</p>

<p>"<i>Am</i> I sorry that I sent you away? You ask
me this&mdash;yet how can you! How many letters
I have written, bidding you, nay <i>begging</i> you to
come back&mdash;how many times have I dropped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
them into the post-bag in the hall&mdash;then, after an
hour's thought, have run in terror and snatched
them out again!</p>

<p>"I am trying so hard to be good! Can I hold
out&mdash;just a little while longer? I am going to
die young, remember, and that is the one hope
which consoles me! It used to be that I shrank
from the medical men who told me this&mdash;who
told me with their pitying eyes and grave looks&mdash;but
now I welcome their gravity. Sir Humphrey
Davy has written a letter to my husband, advising
him to send me off to Italy for this incoming
winter&mdash;but I shall not go! 'I fear that dread
phthisis in the rigor of English cold,' he writes&mdash;but
for me it can not come too soon!</p>

<p>"... Yet all the time the knowledge
haunts me that our lives are passing! I can not
bear it! I spend the hours out in the garden&mdash;where
the sun-dial tells me&mdash;all <i>silently</i>&mdash;of the
day's wearing on.</p>

<p>"Since you went away I can not listen to the
sound of the clock in the hall. That chime&mdash;that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
holy trustful chime&mdash;'O Lord, our God, be
Thou our Guide,' shames the unholy prayer on
my lips.</p>

<p>"Then the clock ticks, ticks, ticks&mdash;all day&mdash;all
night&mdash;on, and on, and on&mdash;to remind me of our
hearts' wearying beats! Does this thought ever
come to madden you? That our hearts have only
so many times to throb in this life&mdash;and when we
are apart every pulsation is wasted?"</p>

<p>I thrust this letter back into its place&mdash;then
hastily closed down the desk. The sensation of
reading a thing like that is not pleasant. She
had written with an awful, <i>awful</i> pain in her
heart&mdash;and she had lived before the days of
anesthetics!</p>

<p>"Women don't feel things like that&mdash;now," I
muttered, as I crossed the room and lowered the
curtain. "They&mdash;they have too many other
things to divert them, I suppose!"</p>

<p>I knew, however, that I was judging everybody
by myself, and certainly <i>I</i> had never known
an awful hurt like that.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, I could listen to a <i>taximeter</i> tick&mdash;for
a whole year&mdash;while Guilford was away from
me, and I don't believe it would make me nervous
for a sight of him."</p>

<p>I was considerably disgusted with myself for
my callousness as I came to this conclusion,
however, and I sat down in the window, overlooking
the tiny strip of rose-garden to think it
out. Presently I crossed the room again to the
desk.</p>

<p><i>"I'm</i> not going to jest at scars&mdash;even if I
haven't felt a wound!" I decided, once and for always.</p>

<p>I opened the desk then and gathered up the
letters, packet by packet, tying them into one big
bundle.</p>

<p>"Publish these&mdash;heart-throbs!"</p>

<p>I was so furious that I could have gagged Uncle
Lancelot if he had opened his mouth&mdash;which he
didn't dare do! In this respect he and grandfather
are very much like living relatives. They'll
argue with you through ninety-nine years of indecision,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
but once you've made up your mind irrevocably
they close their lips into a sullen silence&mdash;saving
their breath for "I told you so!"</p>

<p>"I don't see how anybody could have thought
of such blasphemy!" I kept on. "It would be
like a vivisection! That's what people want
though, nowadays&mdash;they won't have just a book!
They want to be present at a clinic!&mdash;They want
to see others' hearts writhe&mdash;because they have
no feelings of their own!"</p>

<p>Then, after my thoughts had had time to get
away from the past up into the present and
project themselves, somewhat spitefully, into the
future, I made another decision, slamming the
desk lid to accentuate it.</p>

<p>"I shall not publish them myself&mdash;nor ever
give anybody else a chance to publish them!" I
declared. "By rights they are not really mine!
I am just their guardian, because Aunt Patricia
couldn't take them on her journey with her&mdash;and
some day I shall take them on a journey
with me. To Colmere Abbey&mdash;that dream-house
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
of mine! That's the thing to do! And
burn them on the hearth in the library, where she
likely burned his&mdash;if she did burn them! Of
course I can't run the risk of what the next generation
might do!"</p>

<p>This last thought tormented me as I fell asleep.</p>

<p>"No, I can not hand those letters down to
my daughters," I decided drowsily, being in that
hazy state where the mind traverses unheard-of
fields&mdash;unheard-of for waking thought&mdash;and
queer little twisting decisions come. "They
would <i>never</i> be able to understand!"</p>

<p>I was aroused by this hypothesis into sudden
wakefulness.</p>

<p>"Of course they could not understand&mdash;me or
my feelings!" I muttered, sitting up in bed and
facing the darkness defiantly. "They <i>could</i> not&mdash;if&mdash;<i>if</i>
they were Guilford's daughters, too!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="s08">ET TU, BRUTE!</span></h2>

<p>My first waking thought the next morning
had nothing on earth to do with the dilemma
of the day before. I stretched my arms
lazily, then a little shrinkingly, as I remembered
what the daily grind would be. There was to be
a Flag Day celebration of the Daughters of the
American Revolution&mdash;and I was to report
Major Coleman's speech. That's why I shrank.
I am not a society woman.</p>

<p>"D. A. R.," I grumbled, jumping out of bed
and going across to the window to see what kind
of day we were going to have.&mdash;"<i>D-a-r-n!</i>"</p>

<p>Anyway, the day was all right, and after waving
a welcome to the sun&mdash;whose devout worshiper
I am&mdash;I rubbed a circle of dust off the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
mirror and looked at myself. Every woman has
distinctly pretty days&mdash;and distinctly homely
ones; and usually the homely ones come to the
front viciously when you're booked for something
extraordinary. However, this proved to
be one of my good-looking periods, and out of
sheer gratitude I polished off the whole expanse
of the mirror. Incidentally, I am not an absolutely
dustless housekeeper, in spite of my craze
for simplicity. I consider that there are only
two things that need be kept passionately clean
in this life&mdash;the human skin and the refrigerator.</p>

<p>"Are you going to dress for the fête&mdash;before
you go to the office?" mother inquired rebelliously,
as she saw me arranging my hair with that
look of masculine expectation later on in the
morning. "Why don't you get your other work
off, then come back home and dress?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;because," I answered indifferently.</p>

<p>"But the <i>Sons</i> of the Revolution are going to
meet with the Daughters!" she warned.</p>

<p>"I know that."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span></p>

<p>As if to demonstrate my possession of this
knowledge I turned away from the mirror and
displayed my festive charms. A light gray coat-suit
had been converted into the deception of a
gala garment by the addition of Irish lace; and
mother, looking it over contemptuously, went
into her own bedroom for a moment, and came
back carrying her diamond-studded D. A. R. pin.
She held it out toward me&mdash;with the air of a
martyr.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;aren't you going to wear it yourself?"
I asked, with a little feeling of awe at the lengths
of mother-love. She had been regent of her
chapter&mdash;and loved the organization well enough
to go to Washington every year.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;then do you mean to say that you're
not going to Mrs. Walker's to-day?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;mother!"</p>

<p>I turned to her and saw that a tear had
dropped down upon the last golden bar bridging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
the wisp of red, white and blue. There were ten
bars in all, each one engraved for an ancestor&mdash;and
when I wore the thing I felt like a foreign
diplomat sitting for his picture.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, honey?" I asked. She
had always been my little girl, and I felt at times
as if I were unduly severe in my discipline of
her.</p>

<p>"Grace, you don't know how I feel!"</p>

<p>The words came jerkily&mdash;and I knew that I
was in for it.</p>

<p>"Does your head ache?" I asked hastily.
"You'd better get on the car and ride out into
the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My head <i>doesn't</i> ache!" she denied stoutly.
"It's my h-heart!&mdash;To see you&mdash;Grace Chalmers
Christie&mdash;racing around to such things as this in
a coat-suit! You ought, by right of birth and
charm, be the chief ornament of such affairs as
this&mdash;the chief ornament, I say&mdash;yet you go
carrying a <i>'hunk o' copy paper</i>!'"</p>

<p>"In my bag," I modified.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span></p>

<p>"And you get up and leave places before you
get a bite of food&mdash;and race back to that office,
like a wild thing, to <i>'turn it in</i>!'"</p>

<p>This contemptuous use of my own jargon
caused me to laugh.</p>

<p>"And do you think that the wearing of this
heavy pin will prove so exhausting that I'll have
to stay at Mrs. Walker's to-day for a bite of
food?" I asked.</p>

<p>She looked at me in helpless reproach.</p>

<p>"I want you to go to this thing as a D. A. R.,"
she explained, "not as a <i>Herald</i> reporter."</p>

<p>"Then I'll wear it," I promised, kissing her
soothingly. "But you must go, too."</p>

<p>She shook her head again.</p>

<p>"I can't&mdash;I really can't!" she said. "I've got
nothing fine enough to wear. This is going to
be a magnificent thing, every one tells me&mdash;with
all the local Sons&mdash;and this wonderful Major
Coleman to lecture on flags."</p>

<p>She looked at me suspiciously as she uttered
her plaint about the Sons being present, and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
answer, I thrust forward one gray suede pump.</p>

<p>"But I'm ready for any Son on earth&mdash;Oldburgh
earth," I protested. "Don't you <i>see</i> my
exquisite lace collar&mdash;and the pink satin rose in
my chapeau&mdash;and this silken and buskskin footgear?
Surely no true Son would ever pause to
suspect the 'hunk o' copy paper' which lieth beneath
all this glory!"</p>

<p>"Isn't Guilford going with you?" she called
after me as I left the house a few minutes later.
"Will he meet you at the office?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;thank heaven&mdash;it's an awful thing to
have to listen to two men talk at the same time&mdash;especially
when you're taking one down in shorthand&mdash;and
Guilford is mercifully busy this afternoon."</p>

<p>I had a bunch of pink roses, gathered fresh
that morning from our strip of garden, and I
stopped in the office of the owner and publisher
when I had reached the <i>Herald</i> building. Just
because he's old, and drank out of the same canteen
with my grandfather I made a habit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
keeping fresh flowers in his gray Rookwood
vase. This spot of color, together with the occasional
twinkle from his eyes, made the only
break in the dusty newspapery monotony of the
room. He looked up from his desk, and his face
brightened as he saw my holiday attire.</p>

<p>"Well, Grace?"</p>

<p>He started up, big and shaggy&mdash;and wistful&mdash;like
a St. Bernard. I like old men to look like
St. Bernards&mdash;and young ones to look like greyhounds.</p>

<p>"Don't get up&mdash;nor clear off a chair for me," I
warned, catching up the vase and starting toward
the water-cooler. "I can't stay a minute."</p>

<p>He collapsed into his squeaky revolving chair.
When he was a lad a Yankee minnie ball had implanted
a kiss upon his left shoulder-blade, and
he still carried that side with a jaunty little hike&mdash;a
most flirtatious little hike, which, however,
caused the distinguished rest of him to appear
unduly severe.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah! But you must explain the 'dolled-up'
aspect," he begged.</p>

<p>I laughed at the schoolgirl slang.</p>

<p>"Why, this is Flag Day!" I told him. "How
can you have forgotten?&mdash;There will be a gigantic
celebration at Mrs. Hiram Walker's&mdash;and all
the pedigreed world will be there."</p>

<p>He smiled&mdash;slowly.</p>

<p>"And you're writing it up?"</p>

<p>"Just Major Coleman's lecture! They say he
is quite the most learned man in the world on the
subject of flags. He knows them and loves them.
He carries them about with him on these lecture
tours in felt-lined steel cases."</p>

<p>"Cases?" he smiled.</p>

<p>"Certainly," I answered. "Whatever a man
esteems most precious&mdash;or useful&mdash;he has cases
for! The commercial man has his sample cases&mdash;the
medical man his instrument cases&mdash;the
artistic man, his&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Divorce cases," he interrupted dryly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span></p>

<p>"Alas, yes!" I sighed, my thoughts traveling
back.</p>

<p>He wheeled slowly, giving me a glance which
finally tapered off with the pink rosebuds in my
hands.</p>

<p>"Then," he asked kindly, "if you're going to
a very great affair this afternoon, why don't you
keep these flowers and wear them yourself?"</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>"But I'm a newspaper woman!" I said with
dignity. "I might as well wear a vanity-bag as
to wear flowers."</p>

<p>"Bosh! You're not a newspaper woman,
Grace," he denied, still looking at me half sadly.
"And yet&mdash;well, sometimes it is&mdash;just such
women as you who do the amazing things."</p>

<p>"Mother thinks so, certainly!" I laughed.
"But you meant in what way, for instance?"</p>

<p>He hesitated, studying me for a moment,
while I held still and let him, for there's always
a satisfaction in being studied when there's a
satin rose in your hat.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;nothing," he finally answered, with a
look of regret upon his face.</p>

<p>"But it is something!" I persisted, "and, even
if I am in a big hurry, I shan't budge until you
tell me!"</p>

<p>"Well, since you insist&mdash;I only meant to say
that I'd been doing a little thinking on my own
account lately&mdash;as owner and publisher of this
paper, with its interests at heart&mdash;and I've wondered
just how much a woman might accomplish,
after a man had failed."</p>

<p>"A woman?"</p>

<p>"By the ill use of her eyes, I mean," he confessed,
his own eyes twinkling a little. "Women
can gain by the ill use of their eyes what men
fail to accomplish by their straightforward
methods."</p>

<p>"But that's what men hate so in women!" I
said.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Ye-es&mdash;maybe! That is, they make a great
pretense of hating a woman when she uses her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
eyes to any end save one&mdash;charming them for
their own dear sakes!"</p>

<p>"They naturally grudge her the spoils she gains
by the ill use of those important members," I
answered defensively.</p>

<p>"Oh," he put in quickly, "I wasn't going to
suggest that you do any such thing&mdash;unless you
wanted to! I was merely thinking&mdash;that was
all!"</p>

<p>"And besides," I kept on, "all the men who
have ever done anything worth being interviewed
for&mdash;nearly all of them, I mean&mdash;are so
old that&mdash;"</p>

<p>He interrupted me wrathfully.</p>

<p>"Old men are not necessarily blind men, Miss
Christie," he explained. "But we'll change the
subject, if you please!"</p>

<p>"Anyway, it doesn't happen once in twenty
years that a newspaper woman gets a scoop just
because she's a woman," I continued, not being
ready just then to change the subject even if he
had demanded it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span></p>

<p>"It does," he contradicted. "It's one of the
most popular plots for magazine stories."</p>

<p>"Bah! Magazine stories and life are two different
propositions, my dear Captain Macauley!"
I explained with a blasé air. "I should like some
better precedent before I started out on an assignment."</p>

<p>"Yet you are a most unprecedented young
woman," he replied in a meaning tone. "I've suspected
it before&mdash;but recent reports confirm my
worst imaginings."</p>

<p>I glanced at him searchingly.</p>

<p>"You've been talking with mother?" I ventured.</p>

<p>For a moment he was inscrutable.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know you have!" I insisted. "She's
told it to everybody who will listen."</p>

<p>"The story of the Coburn-Colt that wasn't
hatched?"</p>

<p>His face was severe, but the little upward
twist of his left shoulder was twitching as if
with suppressed emotion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span></p>

<p>"She told you with tears in her eyes, I know,"
I kept on. "All the old friends get the tearful
accompaniment."</p>

<p>"Well, miss, doesn't that make you all the
more ashamed of your foolishness?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"My foolishness?"</p>

<p>Something seemed to give way under me as
he said this, for he was always on my side, and
I had never found sympathy lacking before.</p>

<p>"I mean that&mdash;that Don Quixote carried to
an extreme becomes Happy Hooligan," he pronounced.</p>

<p>I drew back in amazement.</p>

<p>"Why, Captain Horace Macauley&mdash;of Company
A&mdash;18th Kentucky Infantry!"</p>

<p>He tried hard not to smile.</p>

<p>"You needn't go so far back&mdash;stay in the
present century, if you please."</p>

<p>"But ever since then&mdash;even to this good day
and in a newspaper office, where the atmosphere
is so cold-blooded that a mosquito couldn't fly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
around without getting a congestive chill, you
know your reputation! Why, you could give the
Don horse spurs and armor, then arrive a full
week ahead of him at a windmill!"</p>

<p>"Tommy-rot."</p>

<p>"Supererogation is a prettier word," I amended,
but he shook his head.</p>

<p>"No! Six syllables are like six figures-they
get you dizzy when you commence fooling with
them! Besides, I was discussing <i>your</i> right to
commit foolish acts of self-sacrificing, Grace, not
mine."</p>

<p>"But it didn't seem foolish to me," I tried to
explain.</p>

<p>"When you're working in this rotten newspaper
office, where no woman could possibly feel
at home, for the vigorous sum of seventy-five
dollars a month?&mdash;Then it doesn't seem idiotic?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"And your mother moping and pining for the
things she ought to have?"</p>

<p>"No-o&mdash;not much!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span></p>

<p>"And Guilford Blake standing by, waiting like
a gentleman for this fever of emancipation to
pass by and desquamation to take place?"</p>

<p>This interested me.</p>

<p>"What's 'desquamation?'" I asked. "I
haven't time to get my dictionary now."</p>

<p>"You couldn't find it in any save a medical
dictionary, likely," he explained, with a pretense
at patience. "Anyway, it's the peeling off process
which follows a high fever&mdash;especially such
fevers as you girls of this restless, modern temperament
so often experience!"</p>

<p>I shivered.</p>

<p>"Ugh! It doesn't sound pretty!" I commented.</p>

<p>"Nor is it pretty," he assured me, "but it's
very wholesome. Once you've caught the fever,
lived through it, peeled off and got a shiny new
skin you're forever immune against its return.
This, of course, is what Guilford is waiting so
patiently for. He is one of the most estimable
young fellows I know, Grace, and&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span></p>

<p>I looked wounded.</p>

<p>"Don't you suppose I know that?" I asked.
Then glancing quickly at the watch bracelet on
my wrist, and seeing with a gasp of relief that
the hands were pointing toward the dangerous
hour of three, I turned toward the door.</p>

<p>"I must hurry!" I plead. "You've really no
idea what an interesting occasion a Flag Day
celebration is, Captain Macauley!"</p>

<p>"No?" he smiled, understanding my sudden
determination to leave.</p>

<p>"Indeed, no! Why, for three hundred and
sixty-four days in the year you may have a gentle
Platonic affection for General Washington,
Paul Revere and the rest, but on the other day&mdash;Flag
Day&mdash;your flame is rekindled into a burning
zeal! You can't afford to be late! You must
hurry!&mdash;Especially if you have to go there on the
street-car!"</p>

<p>"It's a deuced pity you can't get up a zeal for
a devoted <i>living</i> man," he called after me in a
severe voice as I reached the door. "It's a pity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
you can't see the idiocy of this determination of
yours&mdash;before that publishing company revokes
its offer."</p>

<p>"Well, who knows?" I answered, waving him
a gay good-by. "I hate street-cars above everything,
and I'm sorry my coupé isn't waiting at
the door right now!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="s08">FLAG DAY</span></h2>

<p>Now, according to my ethics, there are two
kinds of men who go to daylight parties&mdash;idiots
and those that are dragged there by
their wives.</p>

<p>I had scarcely crossed the lawn of Seven Oaks
and found for myself a modest place beside the
speaker's stand&mdash;which was garlanded with as
many different kinds of flags as there were rats
in Hamelin Town&mdash;when I observed that this
present congregation held a fair sprinkling of
each kind.</p>

<p>But these held my attention for only a moment&mdash;because
of the house in the background,
and the trees overhead. (To be candid, Mrs.
Hiram Walker's country place is not exactly a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
soothing retreat to visit when temptation is barking
at your heels like a little hungry dog&mdash;and
the desire of your heart begins with H.)</p>

<p>"House that's a Home" might have been written
on the sign-board of the car-station much
more truthfully than "Seven Oaks"&mdash;for only
the immense patriarchal ones were included in
the "Seven" there being hordes of lesser ones
which were no more mentioned than children
are when they're getting big enough to be paying
railroad fare. The grove was well cared
for, but not made artificial, and even the luxuriousness
of the house itself could not hurt the
charm, for the Hiram Walkers were human
beings before they were society column acrobats.</p>

<p>Our families had always been friends, so I
happened to know that years and years ago,
when Mr. Walker was a clerk in an insurance
office&mdash;with a horse and buggy for business
through the week and joy unconfined on Sunday&mdash;they
had been in the habit of haunting this
spot, he and his slim young wife&mdash;bringing a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
basket full of supper and thrusting the baby's
milk bottle down into the ice-cream freezer.
Then, there were more years, of longing and
saving; they bought the hill, patiently enduring
a period of blue-prints and architectural advice
before the house was built. By this time Mrs.
Walker's slimness was gone, and Mr. Walker
had found out the vanity of hair tonics&mdash;but the
house was theirs at last. It was big and very
beautiful&mdash;roomy, rather than mushroomy&mdash;and
thoughtful, rambling, old-timey, spreading out a
great deal of portico to the kiss of the sun.
Brown-hooded monks and clanking beads ought,
by rights, to have gone with that portico.</p>

<p>Then, the June sunshine was doing such wonders
with the oaks, great and small, along the
hillsides!</p>

<p>It touched up, with a tinge of glory, even the
shining motor-cars in the driveway. There were
dozens of them&mdash;limousines, touring cars, lady-like
coupés&mdash;with their lazy, half-asleep attendants,
and the regularity of their unbroken files,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
their dignity, their quietness, and the glitter of
the sun against their metal gave them something
of a martial aspect. The silver sheen of the
lamps and levers was brought out in a manner to
suggest a line of marching men, silent, but very
potent&mdash;and enjoying more than a little what
they offered to view, the dazzle of helmet, sword
and coat-of-mail.</p>

<p>The beauty of it all&mdash;the softened glory of the
shade in which I sat making me feel that I was
a spectator at a tournament&mdash;cast a spell over
me, for I never find it very hard to fall spellbound.
Isn't it funny that when you're possessed
of an intelligence which has fits of St.
Vitus' dance they call it Imagination?&mdash;That's
the kind mine is&mdash;jerky and unreliable. It is the
kind of imagination which can take a dried-up
acorn and draw forth a medieval forest; or gaze
upon a rusty old spur and live over again the
time when knights were bold.</p>

<p>But to get back to "those present."</p>

<p>First of all, I noted Oldburgh's best-known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
remittance man. I noted him mentally, mind
you, not paragraphically, for they never made
me do the real drudgery of the society page. He
was sitting beside his mama, swinging her
gauze fan annoyingly against her lorgnette chain.
His divorce the year before had come near uniting
Church and State, since it's a fact that nothing
so cements conflicting bodies like the uprising
of a new common foe; and he had sinned
against both impartially. After him came two
or three financial graybeards; three or four yearling
bridegrooms, not broken yet to taking the bit
between their teeth and staying rebelliously at the
office; a habitual "welcomer to our city"&mdash;Major
Harvey Coleman, a high officer in the Sons of
the American Revolution, and the pièce de
résistence of this occasion&mdash;then&mdash;then&mdash;!</p>

<p>Well, certainly the impassive being next him
was the most unsocial-looking man I had ever
had my eyes droop beneath the gaze of!</p>

<p>He was sitting in the place of honor&mdash;in the
last chair of the first row&mdash;but despite this, he so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
clearly did not belong at that party, and he so
clearly wished himself away that I&mdash;well, I instantly
began searching through the crowds to
find a woman with handcuffs! I felt sure that,
whoever she might be&mdash;she hadn't got him there
any other way!</p>

<p>And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;(my thoughts were coming
in little dashing jerks like that) he <i>was</i>
rather too big for any one woman to have
handled him!</p>

<p>I decided this after another look and another
droop of my own eyes, for he was still looking&mdash;and
that was what I decided about him first&mdash;that
he was very <i>big</i>! Then misbehaving brown
hair came next into my consciousness. It came
to top off a picture which for a moment caused
me to wonder whether he was really a flesh-and-blood
man at Mrs. Walker's reception, or the
spirit of some woodsman&mdash;come again, after
many years, to haunt the grove of the Seven
Oaks.</p>

<p>His New York clothes didn't make a bit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
difference&mdash;except to spoil the illusion a little.
They were all light gray, except for a glimpse
of blue silk hose, and their perfection only served
to remind you that it was a pity for a man who
looked like <i>that</i> to dress like <i>that</i>!</p>

<p>Modern man has but one artistic garment&mdash;a
bathrobe; yet it wouldn't have relieved my feelings
any if this man had been dressed in one.
For he wasn't artistic&mdash;and certainly he wasn't
modern!</p>

<p>Still, I felt the pity of it all, for he ought to
have had better perceptions. He ought to have
had his clothes and cosmic consciousness match!
He ought to have been dressed in a coat of goatskin&mdash;and
his knees ought to have been bare&mdash;and
the rawhide thongs of his moccasins ought
to have been strong and firm!</p>

<p>I had just reached this point in my plans for
the change in his wardrobe, when our hostess
bustled up and shooed me out of my quiet corner.</p>

<p>"Grace," she whispered, "move out a bit, will
you, and let me crowd a man in over there&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span></p>

<p>"In here?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"Where he can't <i>escape</i>!" she explained.</p>

<p>I gathered up my opened sheet of copy paper
and moved obediently into the next chair, which
she had indicated.</p>

<p>"That's right&mdash;thank you! I've found out by
experience that if you let certain suspicious characters
linger on the ragged edges of a crowd like
this they're sure to disappear."</p>

<p>Then she turned and beckoned to my Fifth-Avenue-looking
backwoodsman&mdash;with a smile
of triumph.</p>

<p>"<i>Him?</i>" I asked in surprise.</p>

<p>She was looking in his direction, so failed to
see the expression of my face.</p>

<p>"It's no more than he deserves&mdash;having this
American Revolution rubbed in on him," she observed
absently. "I have never worked so hard
in my life over any one man as I have over this
identical Maitland Tait!"</p>

<p>I saw him rise and come toward her&mdash;then I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
began having trouble with my throat. I couldn't
breathe very easily.</p>

<p>"Maitland Tait!" I gasped.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;<i>the</i> Maitland Tait!"</p>

<p>Her voice sounded with a brass-band echo of
victory.</p>

<p>"But how did you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By outwitting Pollie Kendall&mdash;plague take
her!"</p>

<p>The man was coming leisurely, stopping once
to speak to one of the graybeard financiers.</p>

<p>"Have you met him?" Mrs. Walker asked
carelessly, as he approached.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>She turned to him.</p>

<p>"I'm going to put you in here&mdash;where you'll
have to stay," she laughed, her big, heavy
frame looking dwarfed beside his own towering
height.</p>

<p>"I wasn't going to run away."</p>

<p>"No? You can't always tell&mdash;and I thought
it safe to take every precaution, for this lecture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
may be long, and it's certain to be irritating to
one of your nationality.&mdash;In this location you'll
be in the clutches of the Press, you see, and&mdash;by
the way, you must meet Miss Christie!&mdash;Mr.
Tait, Miss Christie!"</p>

<p>His face was still perfectly impassive, and he
bowed gravely&mdash;with that down-to-the-belt
grace which foreigners have. I nodded the pink
satin rose on my hat in his direction. This was
all! Neither made any further demonstration
than that!&mdash;And to think that since Creation's
dawn&mdash;the world over&mdash;the thing is done just
as idly and carelessly as that! "Mr. Tait, Miss
Christie!"&mdash;These are the words which were
said&mdash;and, dear me, all the days of one's life
ought to be spent in preparation for the event!</p>

<p>"You are a Daughter of the Revolution, I presume?"
his voice finally asked me&mdash;a deep clear
voice, which was strong enough to drown out
the Wagnerian processionals beating at that moment
against my brain, and to follow me off on
the mother-of-pearl cloud I had embarked upon.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
It was a glorious voice, distinctly un-American,
but with the suggestion of having the ability to
do linguistic contortions. He looked like a man
who had traveled far&mdash;over seas and deserts&mdash;and
his voice confirmed it. It proclaimed that he
could bargain with equal ease in piasters and
pence. Still, it was a big wholesome voice. It
matched the coat of goatskin, the bare knees and
the moccasins I had planned for him.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," I answered.</p>

<p>Our eyes met for an instant, as he disengaged
his gaze from that ten-barred insignia on my
coat. Far, far back, concealed by his dark iris,
was a tinge of amused contempt.</p>

<p>"Then I dare say you're interested in this occasion?"
he inquired. I shouldn't say that he
inquired, for he didn't. His tone held a challenge.</p>

<p>"No, indeed, I'm not!" I answered foolishly.
"I came only because I have to write up Major
Coleman's speech for my paper. I am a special
writer for the <i>Herald</i>."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span></p>

<p>And it was then that he smiled&mdash;really smiled.
I saw a transformation which I had never seen
in any other man's face, for with him a smile
escapes! There is a breaking up of the ruggedness,
an eclipse of the stern gravity for a moment,
and&mdash;no matter how much you had cared
for these an instant before&mdash;you could not miss
them then&mdash;not in that twinkling flood of radiance!</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;so you're not an ancestor-worshiper?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"But I thought Americans were!" he insisted.</p>

<p>"Americans?" I repeated loftily. "Why, of
course, that's an English&mdash;religion."</p>

<p>"Not always," he answered grimly, and the
Italian band stationed behind the clump of boxwood
cut short any further conversation.</p>

<p>I was glad, for I did not want to talk to him
then. I merely wanted to stand off&mdash;and look at
him&mdash;and tell myself what manner of man he
must be.</p>

<p>To do this I glanced down at my copy paper,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
with one eyelid raised in favor of his profile. An
ancestor-worshiper? Absurd! Ancestors were
quite out of the question with him, I felt sure.
There was something gloriously <i>traditionless</i>
about his face and expansive frame. But his
hands? Those infallible records of what has
gone before?&mdash;I dropped my eyes to their normal
position. His hands were <i>good</i>! They were
big and long and brown&mdash;that shade of brownness
that comes to a meerschaum pipe after it
has been kissed a time or two by nicotine. And
his hair was brown, too light by several shades
to match with his very dark eyes, but it likely
looked lighter on account of its conduct, standing
up, and away, and back from his face. His
complexion spoke of an early-to-bed and early-to-tub
code of ethics. His nose and mouth were
well in the foreground.</p>

<p>"You are a man who cares nothing at all for
your ancestors&mdash;but you'll care a great deal for
your descendants!" was the summing up I finally
made of him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span></p>

<p>At the close of the band's Hungarian Rhapsody
he leaned over and whispered to me.</p>

<p>"Did you say the <i>Herald</i>?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I have had my&mdash;attention called to your
paper recently," he said, in so serious a tone that
I was compelled to look up and search for the
smile which I felt must lurk behind it. And
when I saw it there I felt reassured, and smiled
in response.</p>

<p>"So they told me at the office," I said with
great cordiality. "Is it three or four of our reporters
you've thrown down your front steps?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I haven't got close enough to them to
throw them down the steps," he disclaimed
quickly. "That's one thing you have to guard
against with reporters. They've got you&mdash;if
they once see the whites of your eyes!"</p>

<p>I felt it my duty to bristle, in defense of my
kind.</p>

<p>"Not unless your eyes <i>talk</i>," I said. Then,
when he stared at me in uncertainty for a moment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
I dropped my own eyes again, for I felt that
they were proclaiming their convictions as loudly
as a Hyde Park suffragette meeting.</p>

<p>The band at that moment struck up <i>The Star-Spangled
Banner</i> in a manner to suggest the
president's advent into the theater, and I
searched in my bag for my pencil. I had seen
the lecturer cough.</p>

<p>"I say&mdash;how long is this convocation supposed
to last?" Maitland Tait inquired in a very
inconspicuous whisper, as the white-flanneled
lion of the affair arose from his chair and became
the cynosure of lorgnettes.</p>

<p>"Well, this talk will absorb about forty-five
minutes, I should hazard," I said. Already I
had had the forethought to jot down the usual
opening: "Ladies and Gentlemen&mdash;Daughters
and Sons of the American Revolution: It is
with a feeling of profoundest pleasure that I
have the privilege of being with you to-day,"
etc. So for the moment my attention was undivided.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span></p>

<p>"And there will be other talks?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And a walk through the gardens, I believe
Mrs.&mdash;Mrs. Walker said?"</p>

<p>"Probably so. The Seven Oaks gardens are
very lovely in June."</p>

<p>At the mention of gardens his eyes wandered,
with what I fancied was a tinge of homesickness,
toward the colorful flowering spaces beyond the
box hedges. There were acres and acres of
typical English gardens back there; and the odor
of the sweet old-fashioned shrubs came in on
gentle heat waves from the open area. He looked
as if he would like to be back there in those
English-looking gardens&mdash;with all the people
gone.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="s08">STRAWS POINT</span></h2>

<p>"And are you going to write up the whole
thing?" he inquired, during a little commotion
caused by one of the large flags slipping
from its stand and threatening to obscure the
speaker.</p>

<p>"You mean make a society column report of
it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"No. I'm a sort of special feature writer on
the <i>Herald</i>, and I am to get only this speech of
Major Coleman's to put in my Sunday page."</p>

<p>The lecture had commenced in good earnest
by this time, and I was scribbling away in shorthand
as I talked.</p>

<p>"Not one among us is insensible to the visions
of patriotic pride and affection which the very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
name of 'Old Glory' conjures up within us, but
at the same time we may do well to review, quite
dispassionately, once in a while the wonderful
chain of historical changes which came about in
evolving this flag to its present form....
For we all realize that there is no perfect thing
in this world which has not been an evolution
from some imperfect thing.... When
Pope Gregory, the"&mdash;Somethingth, I quite failed
to catch his number&mdash;"granted to Scotland the
white cross of St. Andrew, and to England the
red cross of St. George, he faintly surmised what
a tempest in a teapot he was stirring up!"</p>

<p>He paused, and the man at my side got in a
word, edgewise.</p>

<p>"All of it?" he asked, looking aghast at the
pages of long-tailed dots and dashes under my
hand. I laughed.</p>

<p>"I'm paid to do it," I answered. "I don't disfigure
my handwriting this way for nothing."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;you must be very clever," he commented,
so appalled at the thought that he forgot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
he was talking to a stranger. I like that faculty.
I like a man who dares to be awkwardly sincere.</p>

<p>"Not clever&mdash;only very needy," I replied,
turning over the page as I saw the lecturer replace
the white flag of St. Andrew into its stand
and take up the thread of his talk. "And I don't
know that I need get every word of the discourse.
The women who read my page don't
care a rap about flags&mdash;but they do care to see a
picture of Major Coleman and his wife and their
dog on the piazza of their winter home, just out
from Tampa!&mdash;I've got to have enough of this
lecture to carry that picture."</p>

<p>He nodded gravely.</p>

<p>"I see. But after you get this report?"</p>

<p>"I'm going back to the city," I answered. "I
have to catch the five o'clock car in."</p>

<p>"... The jealousy became so fierce between
the two nations&mdash;the absurd jealousy over
which should first salute the flag of the other&mdash;St.
George claiming great superiority in the way
of godliness over St. Andrew, and St. Andrew,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
with the true Scotch spirit, stiffening his neck to
the breaking point, while waiting for St. George
to take off his hat to him, that when the story
of this dissension reached the ears of Pope Gregory,
he&mdash;"</p>

<p>I never knew what he did until afterward, for
at that moment I saw Maitland Tait slip his
watch out carefully, guarding the action with
an outspread left hand.</p>

<p>"I've an engagement at five, too," he said.</p>

<p>"... He determined to lose no time,"
was the next sentence I found myself jotting
down on paper, and wondering whether Major
Coleman had really said such a thing or whether
it had been born in my mind of the stress of the
moment.... "He was a man of the
most impulsive, sometimes of the most erratic,
actions."</p>

<p>"Of course!" my heart said between thumps.
"I shouldn't like him if he were not."</p>

<p>"I can make my excuses to Mrs. Walker at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
the same time you make yours," the deep voice
said, in a surprisingly soft tone.</p>

<p>"... For he saw in such a course protection
and peace," Major Coleman announced.
"All the world suspected that his ultimate aim
was union, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An international alliance," my heart explained,
as I jotted down the words of the lecturer.</p>

<p>"Mayn't I take you back to town in my car?"</p>

<p>"... And all the world knew that he
was a man absolutely untrammeled by tradition,"
the white-flanneled one proclaimed.</p>

<p>"Thank you, that would be lovely, but I'm
afraid Mrs. Walker won't consent to your going
so soon," I said between curlicues.</p>

<p>"I'm going, however," he answered. "I've an
important engagement, and&mdash;I'm not going to stay
at this&mdash;this," he closed his lips firmly, but the
silence said "<i>cussed</i>," that dear, fierce, American
adjective. "I'm not going to stay at this party
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
one minute after you're gone. I don't like to
talk to just any woman."</p>

<p>"... Yet I would have you understand
that he was a temperamental man," was thundered
in a warning tone from the speaker's stand. "He
was quick in judgment and action, but he was
fine and sensitive in spirit. I've never a doubt
that he disliked and feared the occasion which
caused this precipitate action. He was quaking
in his boots all the time, but he was courageous.
He decided to make brief work of formalities
and take a short cut to his heart's desire."</p>

<p>"What was it he did?" I asked of Mr. Tait,
startled at the thought of what I'd missed. "Do
you know what this thing was that Pope Gregory
did?"</p>

<p>"No-o&mdash;listen a minute!" he suggested.</p>

<p>"... Can't you just imagine now that
he was afraid of what people might say&mdash;or do?"
asked the major encouragingly. "It was absolutely
unprecedented in the annals of history&mdash;such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
a quick, rash and sudden decision. If England
and Scotland were going to be eternally
bickering over their flags, they should have <i>one</i>
flag! They should be united! They should&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The <i>Union Jack</i>!" whispered the deep voice
close at my side, while the grave dark eyes
lighted, as&mdash;as they should have lighted, or I'd
never have forgiven him. "He created the Union
Jack, by George!"</p>

<p>And the speaker on the stand demonstrated
the truth of this conclusion by displaying a big
British flag, which caught in its socket as he attempted
to lift it and occasioned another pause in
the speech.</p>

<p>"This enthusiasm makes me hungry," Maitland
Tait observed, as the audience courteously
saluted the ancient emblem of hostility,
and the echoes of applause died away. "Since
we're going to get no tea here, can't we drive by
some place up-town? There's a good-looking
place in Union Street&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span></p>

<p>"But that would make you very late for your
engagement, I'm afraid," I demurred. "It will
take some little time to drive in."</p>

<p>He looked at me wonderingly for a moment.</p>

<p>"My engagement? Oh, yes&mdash;but it can wait."</p>

<p>"Then, if it can, I'm afraid Mrs. Walker will
not let you off. I happen to know that&mdash;"</p>

<p>He cut short my argument by motioning me
to pay attention to the speaker, who at the moment
had replaced the flag of Pope Gregory's
cunning, and was talking away at a great rate.</p>

<p>"... Yet, who can say that the hastiest
actions do not often bring about the best results?
Certainly when a decision is made out of an excessive
desire to bring happiness to all parties
concerned, its immediate action can not fail to
denote a wholesome heartiness which should always
be emulated.... Different from most
men of his native country, possessing a genuinely
warm heart, a subtle mentality, coupled
with a conscience which impelled him always toward
the right, he was enabled, by this one impetuous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
act, to become a benefactor of mankind!
What he longed for was harmony&mdash;a harmonious
union; and what he has achieved has been
the direct outcome of a great longing. He
created a union&mdash;wholesome, strengthening and
permanent," I took down in shorthand.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>I have a confused impression&mdash;I suppose I
should say post-impression, for I didn't remember
anything very clearly until afterward&mdash;that
Betsy Ross, Pope Gregory, the Somethingth, and
Mrs. Hiram Walker were all combining to tie
my hands and feet together with thongs of red,
white and blue.</p>

<p>It seemed hours and hours before that lecture
ended, then more hours before the tall restless
man and I could make our way through a sea of
massaged faces to a distant point where our
hostess stood giving directions to a white-coated
servant.</p>

<p>She turned to me, with a fluttering little air of
regret, when I reached her side.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span></p>

<p>"Grace, surely you don't have to hurry off at
this unchristian hour!" she insisted. "My dear,
you really should stay! Solinski has arranged
the loveliest spread, and I'm not going to keep
the company waiting forever to get to it, either!&mdash;The
ices will be the surprise of the season."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," I began, but she interrupted me.</p>

<p>"Why <i>didn't</i> your mother come?"</p>

<p>Already her vague regret over my own hasty
departure had melted away, and as she saw the
tall man following me, evidently bent upon the
same mission as mine, she put her query in a perfunctory
way to hide her chagrin.</p>

<p>"Mother couldn't come, Mrs. Walker. There
is only one D. A. R. pin in the family, as you
know&mdash;and I had to wear that."</p>

<p>Maitland Tait, looking over my shoulder,
heard my explanation and smiled.</p>

<p>"It is a great deprivation to miss the rest of
your charming party, Mrs. Walker," he began,
but as he mentioned going, in a cool final voice,
our hostess emitted a little terrified shriek.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span></p>

<p>"What? Not you, too!"</p>

<p>His face was the picture of deep contrition.</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> sorry," he said, as only an Englishman
can say it, and it always sounds as if he were
digging regret up out of his heart with a shovel,
"but I have an important engagement that really
can not wait&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And the General Seth O'Callen Chapter fairly
holding its breath to meet you!" she wailed,
the despair in her voice so genuine that it was
impossible to keep back a smile. "That is our
chapter composed entirely of <i>young</i> women, you
know, and I'd given their regent my word of
honor that you'd be here to-day!"</p>

<p>"Which the Regent has entirely forgotten in
the charm of that delightful lecture we've just
heard, I'm sure," he answered, his tones regretfully
mollifying. "If it were at all possible for
me to get word to the man&mdash;the men&mdash;"</p>

<p>The rest of the fabrication was cut short and
drowned out by the shriek of a trolley-car, grinding
noisily round a curve of the track at that instant.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
It was the five-o'clock car, and I had
grown to watch for its shriek as fearfully as
ever Cinderella listened for the stroke of twelve
from the castle clock. For me there was never a
garden party without its trolley-car back to the
city&mdash;its hateful, five-o'clock car&mdash;its hurried,
businesslike, hungry summons&mdash;while ice in tea
glasses tinkled to the echo.</p>

<p>From force of long habit now that grinding
sound of the car-wheels acted upon my nervous
system like a fire alarm upon an engine horse&mdash;and
I started to run.</p>

<p>"Charming party&mdash;so sorry to have to rush
off this way&mdash;hope next time I'll not be so busy&mdash;yes,
I'll tell mother!"</p>

<p>I gathered the folds of copy paper close, having
forgotten to thrust them away out of sight
into my bag, and made a break for the front
gate. Then, as I reached the line of waiting
motor-cars, I remembered&mdash;and stopped still
with a foolish little feeling.</p>

<p>Looking back I saw Mrs. Walker shaking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
hands in an injured fashion with her troublesome
lion&mdash;who, after the manner of lions,
proved that he could afford anxiety as well after
being caught as before,&mdash;and turning her back
resolutely upon his departing glory.&mdash;The whole
of the General Seth O'Callen Chapter was before
her, I knew she was thinking bitterly.</p>

<p>"Thank goodness she won't see this!" I volunteered
to myself, as the tall gray figure came
hastily down the line and caught up with me.
"She has troubles enough of her own, and&mdash;and
she won't stop to wonder over whether I went
back to the city by trolley, motor, or chariot of
fire!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="s08">LONGEST WAY HOME</span></h2>

<p>"You hadn't forgotten?" he inquired, coming
up behind me with an expression of
uneasiness as I passed the first two or three cars
in the line.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;that is, I forgot for only a moment!
I'm so used to going to town on this trolley-car."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;ah, here we are&mdash;"</p>

<p>The limousine to which I was conducted was a
gleaming dark-blue affair, with light tan upholstery,
and the door-knobs, clock-case and mouth-piece
of the speaking-tube were of tortoise-shell.</p>

<p>The chauffeur touched something and the big
creature began a softened, throbbing breathing.
Isn't it strange how we can not help regarding
automobiles as <i>creatures</i>? Sometimes we think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
of them as gliding swans&mdash;at other times as fiery-eyed
dragons. It all depends upon whether
<i>we're</i> the duster, or the dustee.</p>

<p>I gained the idea as I stepped into this present
one&mdash;which of course belonged to the gliding
swan variety&mdash;that its master must be rather ridiculously
well-to-do&mdash;for a cave-man. His initials
were on the panels, and the man at the wheel
said, "Mr. Tait, sir," after a fashion that no
American-trained servant, white, black, or almond-eyed,
ever said. Evidently the car had
come down from Pittsburgh and the chauffeur
had made a longer journey. Together, however,
they spelled perfection&mdash;and luxury. Still,
strange to say, the notion of this man's possible
wealth did not get on my throat and suffocate
me, as the notion of Guilford's did. I felt that
the man himself really cared very little about it
all. The idea of his being a man who could do
hard tasks patiently did not fade in the glamour
of this damask and tortoise-shell.</p>

<p>"Which is&mdash;the longest way to town?" he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
asked in a perfectly grave, matter-of-fact way as
we started.</p>

<p>"Down this lane to the Franklin Pike, then out
past Fort Christian to Belcourt Boulevard&mdash;and
on to High Street," I replied in a perfectly grave,
matter-of-fact way, as if he were a tubercular
patient, bound to spend a certain number of
hours in aimless driving every day.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he answered very seriously, then
turned to the chauffeur.</p>

<p>"Collins, can you follow this line? I think
we drove out this way the day the car came?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir&mdash;thank you," the man declared,
slipping his way in and out among the throngs
of other vehicles.</p>

<p>Then as we whirled away down the pike I kept
thinking of this man&mdash;this young Englishman,
who had come to America and elevated himself
into the position of vice-president and general-manager
of the Consolidated Traction Company,
but, absurdly enough, no thought of the limousine
nor the traction company came into my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
musings. I thought of him as a spirit&mdash;a spirit-man,
who had lived in the woods. He had dwelt
in a hut&mdash;or a cave&mdash;and toiled with his hands,
hewing down trees, burning charcoal, eating
brown bread at noon. Then, at dusk, he laid
aside his tools, rumbling homeward in a great
two-wheeled cart, whistling as he went, but softly&mdash;because
he was deep in thought.</p>

<p>The seven <i>ages</i> of man are really nothing to
be compared in point of interest with the different
conditions of mind which women demand
of them.</p>

<p>Very young girls seek about&mdash;often in vain&mdash;for
a man who can compel; then later, they demand
one who can feel; afterward their own expansion
clamors for one who can understand&mdash;but
the final stage of all is reached when the feminine
craving can not be satisfied save by the man who
can <i>achieve</i>.</p>

<p>This, of course, indicates that the woman
herself is experienced&mdash;sometimes even to the
point of being a widow&mdash;but it is decidedly a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
satisfying state of mind when it is once reached,
because it is permanent.</p>

<p>And your man of achievement is pretty apt to
be an uncomplicated human. His deepest "problem"
is how to make the voices of the nightingale
and alarm clock harmonize. For he is a
lover between suns&mdash;and a <i>laborer</i> during them.</p>

<p>At Solinski's Japanese tea-room in Union
Street, the limousine slowed up. The band was
playing <i>The Rosary</i> as we went in, for it was
the hour of the afternoon for the professional
seers and seen of Oldburgh's medium world to
drop in off the sidewalks for half an hour and
dawdle over a tutti-frutti. The ultra-sentimental
music always gets such people as these&mdash;and the
high excruciating notes of this love-wail were
ringing out with an intense poignancy.</p>

<p>"Each hour a pearl&mdash;each pearl a prayer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which table do you prefer?" my companion
asked me, but for a moment I failed to answer.
I was looking up at the clock, and I saw that the
hands were pointing to six. I had met Maitland
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
Tait at four!&mdash;Thus I had two pearls already
on my string, I reckoned.</p>

<p>"Oh, which table&mdash;well, farther back, perhaps!"</p>

<p>I came down to earth after that, for getting
acquainted with the caprices of a man's appetite
is distinctly an earthly joy. Yet it certainly
comes well within the joy class, for nothing else
gives you the comfortable sense of possession
that an intimate knowledge of his likes and dislikes
bestows.</p>

<p>Just after the "each-hour-a-pearl" stage you
begin to feel that you have a <i>right</i> to know
whether he takes one lump or two! And the
homely, every-day joys are decidedly the best.
You don't tremble at the sounds of a man's rubber
heels at the door, perhaps, after you're so
well acquainted with him that you've set him a
hasty supper on the kitchen table, or your fingers
have toyed with his over the dear task of baiting
a mouse-trap together&mdash;but he gets a dearness in
this phase which a pedestal high as Eiffel Tower
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
couldn't afford.&mdash;It is this dearness which makes
you endure to see Prince Charming's coronet
melted down into ducats to buy certified milk!</p>

<p>"And what are&mdash;those?" Maitland Tait asked,
after the tea-service was before us, and I had
poured his cup. He was looking about the place
with a frank interest, and his gaze had lighted
upon a group of marcelled, manicured manikins
at a near-by table. They were chattering and
laughing in an idly nervous fashion.</p>

<p>I dropped in two lumps of sugar and passed
him his cup.</p>

<p>"They are wives," I answered.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Just wives."</p>

<p>Being English, it took him half a second to
smile&mdash;but when he did I forgave him the delay.</p>

<p>"<i>Just</i> wives? Then that means not mothers,
nor helpmeets, nor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nor housekeepers, nor suffragettes, nor
saints, nor sinners, nor anything else that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
Lord intended, nor apprehended," I finished up
with a fierce suddenness, for that was what Guilford
wanted me to be. "They're <i>just</i> wives."</p>

<p>He stirred his tea thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"That's what I find all over America," he said,
but not with the air of making a discovery.
"Men must work, and women must <i>eat</i>."</p>

<p>"And the sooner it's over the sooner to&mdash;the
opera," I said.</p>

<p>He looked at me in surprise.</p>

<p>"Then you recognize it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Recognize it? Of course <i>I</i> recognize it&mdash;but
I'm not a fair sample. I work for my living."</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment, looking at the
manikins with a sort of half-hearted pity.</p>

<p>"If they could all be induced to work they'd
not be what they are&mdash;to men," he observed.</p>

<p>"To men?"</p>

<p>"I find that an American wife is a tormenting
side-issue to a man's busy life," he said, with a
tinge of regret. "And I am sorry, too&mdash;for they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
are most charming. For my part, I should like
a woman who could do things&mdash;who was clever
enough to be an inspiration."</p>

<p>I nodded heartily, forgetful of personalities.</p>

<p>"I too like the workers in the world," I coincided.
"My ideal man is one whose name will
be made into a verb."</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"Like Marconi, eh, and Pasteur&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And Boycott, and Macadam, and&mdash;oh, a host
of others!"</p>

<p>It was quite a full minute before he spoke
again.</p>

<p>"I don't see how I could make my name into a
verb," he said quietly, "but I must begin to think
about it. It is certainly a valuable suggestion."</p>

<p>It was my turn to laugh, which I did, nervously.</p>

<p>"In Oldburgh, Tait seems to stand for the
opposite of dictate," I hazarded. "That means
to <i>talk</i>, and you won't&mdash;talk."</p>

<p>"But I am talking," he insisted. "I'm asking
you questions as fast as ever I can."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span></p>

<p>"However, your technique is wrong," I replied.
"You shouldn't ask questions of a newspaper
woman. You should let her ask the questions,
and you should furnish the answers."</p>

<p>"But you're not a newspaper woman now, are
you?" he demanded in some alarm. "I hope not&mdash;and
certainly I must ask you questions before
I begin to tell you things. There are quite a few
facts which I wish to find out now."</p>

<p>"And they are, first&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Where you live?"</p>

<p>I told him, and he took from his pocket a small
leather book with his name, Maitland Tait, and
an address in smaller letters which I could not
make out, on the inside lining. In a small, rather
cramped hand, he wrote the address I gave him,
"1919 West Clydemont Place," then looked up at
me.</p>

<p>"Next?" I laughed, in a flutter.</p>

<p>"Next I want to know when you will let me
come to see you?"</p>

<p>"When?" I repeated, rather blankly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span></p>

<p>He drew slightly back.</p>

<p>"I should have said, of course, <i>if</i> you will let
me come, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I shall be very glad to have you come,"
I made haste to explain. "I&mdash;I was only thinking!"</p>

<p>I was thinking of my betrothed&mdash;for the first
time that afternoon.</p>

<p>"The length of time I am to stay in the South
is very uncertain," he went on to explain with a
gentle dignity. "At first it appeared that I might
have to make a long stay, but we are settling our
affairs so satisfactorily that I may be able to get
back to Pittsburgh at any time now. That's
why I feel that I can't afford to lose a single day
in doing the really important things."</p>

<p>"Then come," I said, with a friendly show,
which was in truth a desperate spirit of abandon.
"Come some day&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To-morrow?" he asked.</p>

<p>"To-morrow&mdash;at four."</p>

<p>But during the rest of the meal grandfather and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
Uncle Lancelot came and took their places on
either side of me. They were distinctly de trop,
but I could not get rid of them.</p>

<p>"This is&mdash;really the wrong thing to do, Grace,"
grandfather said, so soberly that when I rose to
go and looked in the mirror to see that my hat
was all right, his own sad blue eyes were looking
out at me in perplexed reproach. "&mdash;Very
wrong."</p>

<p>Then the sad blue eyes took in the lower part
of my face. I believe I've neglected to say that
there is a dimple in my chin, and Uncle Lancelot's
spirit is a cliff-dweller living there. He comes
out and taunts the thoughtful eyes above.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, parson!" he expostulated jauntily
now. "Look on the lips while they are red!
She's <i>young</i>!"</p>

<p>"Youth doesn't excuse folly," said grandfather
severely.</p>

<p>"It exudes it, however," the other argued.</p>

<p>I turned away, resolutely, from their bickering.
I had enough to contend with besides them&mdash;for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
suddenly I had begun wondering what on earth
mother <i>would</i> say, after she'd said: "Grace,
you amaze me!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<span class="s08">MAITLAND TAIT</span></h2>

<p>The only difference between the houses in
West Clydemont Place and museums was
that there was no admission fee at the front door.
Otherwise they were identical, for the "auld lang
syne" flavor greeted you the moment you put
foot into that corner of the town. You knew
instinctively that every family there owned its
own lawn-mower and received crested invitations
in the morning mail.</p>

<p>Yet it was certainly not fashionable! Indeed,
from a butler-and-porte-cochère standpoint it was
shabby. The business of owning your own lawn-mower
arises from a state of mind, rather than
from a condition of finances, anyway. We were
poor, but aloof&mdash;and strung high with the past-tension.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
The admiral, the ambassador and the
artist rubbed our aristocracy in on any stray
caller who lingered in the hall, if they had failed
to be pricked by it on the point of grandfather's
jeweled sword in the library.</p>

<p>I saw 1919 through a new vista as I came up
to it in the late dusk, following the Flag Day
reception, and I wondered what the effect of all
this antiquity would be on the mind of a man
who so clearly disregarded the grandfather clause
in one's book of life. I hoped that he would be
amused by it, as he had been by the long-tailed
D. A. R. badge on my coat.</p>

<p>"You'd better have a little fire kindled up in
the library, Grace," mother observed chillingly
just after lunch that next afternoon. "It's true
it's June, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But the day <i>is</i> bleak and raw," I answered,
with a sudden cordial sense of relief that she was
on speaking terms with me again. "Certainly
I'll tell Cicely to make a fire."</p>

<p>"The dampness of the day has nothing at all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
to do with it," she kept on with frozen evenness.
"I suggested it because a fire is a safe place for a
girl to look into while her profile is being studied."</p>

<p>"Mother!"</p>

<p>Her sense of outraged propriety suddenly
slipped its leash.</p>

<p>"It keeps her eyes looking earnest, instead of
<i>eager</i>," she burst out. "And any girl who'd let
a man&mdash;allow a man&mdash;to run away from a party
whose very magnificence was induced on his account,
and take her off to tea in a public place,
and come to see her the very next afternoon&mdash;a
stranger, and a foreigner at that&mdash;is&mdash;is playing
with fire!"</p>

<p>"You mean she'd better be playing with fire
while he's calling?" I asked quietly. "We must
remember to have the old andirons polished,
then."</p>

<p>She stopped in her task of dusting the parlor&mdash;whose
recesses without the shining new player-piano
suddenly looked as bare and empty as a
shop-window just after the holidays.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span></p>

<p>"You wilfully ignore my warning," she declared.
"If this man left that party yesterday
and comes calling to-day, of course he's impressed!
And if you let him, of course <i>you're</i>
impressed. This much goes without saying; but
I beg you to be careful, Grace! You happen to
have those very serious, <i>betraying</i> eyes, and I
want you to guard them while he's here!"</p>

<p>"By keeping my hands busy, eh?" I laughed.
"Well, I'll promise, mother, if that'll be any relief
to you."</p>

<p>So the fire was kindled, as a preventative
measure; and at four o'clock he came&mdash;not on the
stroke, but ten minutes after. I was glad that
he had patronized the street railway service for
this call, and left the limousine in its own boudoir&mdash;you
couldn't imagine anything so exquisite
being kept in a lesser place&mdash;or I'm afraid that
our little white-capped maid would have mistaken
it for an ambulance and assured him that
nobody was sick. Gleaming blue limousines
were scarce in that section.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span></p>

<p>"Am I early?" he asked, after we had shaken
hands and he had glanced toward the fire with a
little surprised, gratified expression. "I wasted
a quarter of an hour waiting for this car."</p>

<p>Now, a woman can always forgive a man for
being late, if she knows he started on time, so
with this reassurance I began to feel at home
with him. I leaned over and stirred the fire
hospitably&mdash;to keep my eyes from showing just
how thoroughly at home I felt.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;you are not early. I was expecting you
at four, and&mdash;and mother will be down presently."</p>

<p>He studied my profile.</p>

<p>"I was out at the golf club dance last night,"
he said, after a pause, with a certain abruptness
which I had found characterized his more important
parts of speech. I stood the tongs against
the marble mantlepiece and drew back from the
flame.</p>

<p>"Was it&mdash;enjoyable?" I asked politely.</p>

<p>"Extremely. Mrs. Walker was there, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
she had very kindly forgiven me for my defection
of the afternoon. In fact, she was distinctly
cordial. She talked to me a great deal of
you and your mother."</p>

<p>My heart sank. It always does when I find
that my women friends have been talking a great
deal about me.</p>

<p>"Oh, did she?"</p>

<p>"She is very fond of you, it seems&mdash;and very
puzzled by you."</p>

<p>"Puzzled because I work for the <i>Herald</i>?"</p>

<p>I spoke breathlessly, for I wondered if Mrs.
Walker had told of the Guilford Blake puzzle,
as well; but after one look into the candid half-amused
eyes I knew that this information had
been withheld.</p>

<p>"Well, yes. She touched upon that, among
other things."</p>

<p>"But what things?" I asked impatiently. At
the door I heard the maid with the tea tray. "I
suppose, however, just the usual things that people
tell about us. That we have been homeless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
and penniless&mdash;except for this old barn&mdash;since I
was a baby, and that, one by one, the pomps of
power have been stripped from us?"</p>

<p>He looked at me soberly for a moment.</p>

<p>"Yes, she told me all this," he said.</p>

<p>"And that our historic rosewood furniture was
sold, years ago, to Mrs. Hartwell Gill, the
grocer's wife who used the chair-legs as battering-rams?"</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"Against Oldburgh's unwelcoming doors?
Yes."</p>

<p>"And that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That you belonged to the most aristocratic
family in the whole state," he interrupted softly.
"So aristocratic that even the possession of the
rosewood furniture is an open sesame! And of
course this state is noted for its blooded beings,
even in my own country."</p>

<p>"Really?" I asked, with a little gratified surprise.</p>

<p>"Indeed, yes!" he replied earnestly. "And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
Mrs. Walker told me something that I had not in
the least thought to surmise&mdash;that you are a
descendant of the famous artist, Christie. I
don't know why I happened not to think about it,
for the name is one which an Englishman instantly
connects with portrait galleries. He
was very favorably known on our side."</p>

<p>"Yes. He had a very remarkable&mdash;a very
pathetic history," I said.</p>

<p>Turning around, he glanced at a small portrait
across the room.</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;is this James Christie?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. There is a larger one in the hall."</p>

<p>He walked across the room and examined the
portrait. After a perfunctory survey, which did
not include any very close examination of the
strong features&mdash;rugged and a little harsh, and
by no means the glorious young face which had
been a lodestar to Lady Frances Webb&mdash;he
turned back to me. For a moment I fancied
that he was going to say something bitter and
impulsive&mdash;something that held a tinge of mass-hatred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
for class, but his expression changed suddenly.
I saw that his impulse had passed, and
that what he would say next would be an afterthought.</p>

<p>"Do you care for him&mdash;for this sort of thing?"
he asked, waving his hand carelessly toward the
other portraits in the room and toward the
sword, lying there in an absurd sort of harmlessness
beneath its glass case. "I imagined that you
didn't."</p>

<p>He spoke with a tinge of disappointment. Evidently
he was sorry to find me so pedigreed a
person.</p>

<p>"I do&mdash;and I don't," I answered, coming
across the room to his side and drawing back a
curtain to admit a better light. "I certainly care
for&mdash;him."</p>

<p>"The artist?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But why?" he demanded, with a sudden twist
of perversity to his big well-shaped mouth. "To
me it seems such a waste of time&mdash;this sentiment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
for romantic antiquity. But I am not an unprejudiced
judge, I admit. I have spent all the
days of my life hating aristocracy."</p>

<p>"Oh, my feeling for him is not caused by his
aristocracy," I made haste to explain. "And indeed,
the Christies were very commonplace people
until he elevated them into the ranks of fame.
He was not only an artist of note, but he was a
very strong man. It is this part of his history
that I revere, and when I was a very young girl
I 'adopted' him&mdash;from all the rest of my ancestors&mdash;to
be the one I'd care for and feel a pride
in."</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"Of course you don't understand," I attempted
to explain with a little flurry. "No <i>man</i> would
ever think of adopting an ancestor, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>He interrupted me, his smile growing gentler.</p>

<p>"I think I understand," he said. "I did the
selfsame thing, years ago when I was a boy.
But my circumstances were rather different from
yours. I selected my grandfather&mdash;my mother's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
father, because he was clean and fine and strong!
He was&mdash;he was a collier in Wales."</p>

<p>"A collier?" I repeated, wondering for the
moment over the unaccustomed word.</p>

<p>"A coal-miner," he explained briefly. "He
was honest and kind-hearted&mdash;and I took him
for my example. He left me no heirlooms
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>I turned away, looking at the room's furnishings
with a feeling of reckless contempt.</p>

<p>"Heirlooms are&mdash;are a nuisance to keep
dusted!" I declared quickly.</p>

<p>"Yet you evidently like them," he said, as we
took our places again before the fire, and the
little maid, in her nervous haste, made an unnecessary
number of trips in and out. The firelight
was glowing ruddily over the silver things
on the tea-table, and looking up, I caught his
eyes resting upon the ring I wore&mdash;Guilford's
scarab. "That ring is likely an heirloom?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;the story goes that Mariette himself
found it," I elucidated, slipping the priceless old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
bit of stone off my hand and handing it to him
to examine.</p>

<p>But as I talked my head was buzzing, for
grandfather was at one ear and Uncle Lancelot
was at the other.</p>

<p>"Grace, you ought to tell him!" grandfather
commanded sharply. "Tell him this minute!
Say to him: 'This ring is an heirloom in the
family of my betrothed.'"</p>

<p>"<i>Rot</i>, parson!" came in Uncle Lancelot's dear
comforting tones. "Shall a young woman take
it for granted that every man who admires the
color of her eyes is interested in her entire history?&mdash;Why,
it would be absolutely indelicate
of Grace to tell this man that she's engaged. It's
simply none of his business."</p>

<p>"You'll see! You'll see!" grandfather warned&mdash;and
my heart sank, for when a member of your
family warns you that you'll see, the sad part of
it is that you <i>will</i> see.</p>

<p>"It's a royal scarab, isn't it?" Maitland Tait
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
asked, turning the ancient beetle over and viewing
the inscription on the flat side.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;perhaps&mdash;oh, I don't know, I'm sure,"
I answered in a bewildered fashion. Then suddenly
I demanded: "But what else did Mrs.
Walker tell you? Surely she didn't leave off
with the mention of one illustrious member of
my family."</p>

<p>"She told me about your great-aunt&mdash;the queer
old lady who left James Christie's relics to you
because you were the only member of the family
who didn't keep a black bonnet in readiness for
her funeral," he laughed, as he handed me back
the ring.</p>

<p>"They were just a batch of letters," I corrected,
"not any other relics."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;the letters written by Lady Frances
Webb," he said.</p>

<p>It was my turn to laugh.</p>

<p>"I knew that Mrs. Walker must have been
talkative," I declared. "She didn't tell you the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
latest touch of romance in connection with those
letters, did she?"</p>

<p>He was looking into the fire, with an expression
of deep thoughtfulness; and I studied his
profile for a moment.</p>

<p>"Late romance?" he asked in a puzzled fashion,
as he turned to me.</p>

<p>"A publishing company has made me an offer
to publish those letters! To make them into a
stunning 'best-seller,' with a miniature portrait
of Lady Frances Webb, as frontispiece, I dare
say, and the oftenest-divorced illustrator in
America to furnish pictures of Colmere Abbey,
with the lovers mooning 'by Norman stone!'"</p>

<p>He was silent for a little while.</p>

<p>"No, she didn't tell me this," he finally answered.</p>

<p>"Then it is because she doesn't know it!" I explained.
"You see, mother is still too grieved
to mention the matter to any one by telephone&mdash;and
it happens that she hasn't met Mrs. Walker
face to face since the offer was made."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>

<p>"And&mdash;rejected?" he asked, with a little smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, but how did you know?"</p>

<p>The smile sobered.</p>

<p>"There are some things one <i>knows</i>," he answered.
"Yet, after all, what are you going to
do with the letters? If you don't publish them
now how are you going to be sure that some
other&mdash;some future possessor will not?"</p>

<p>"I can't be sure&mdash;that's the reason I'm not
going to run any risks," I told him. "I'm going
to burn them."</p>

<p>He started.</p>

<p>"But that would be rather a pity, wouldn't it?"
he asked. "She was such a noted writer that I
imagine her letters are full of literary value."</p>

<p>"It would be a cold-blooded thing for <i>me</i> to
do," I said thoughtfully. "I've an idea that some
day I'll take them back to England and&mdash;and
burn them there."</p>

<p>"A sort of feeling that they'd enjoy being
buried on their native soil?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I'll take them to Colmere Abbey&mdash;her old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
home," I explained. "To me the place has
always been a house of dreams! She describes
portions of the gardens in her letters&mdash;tells him
of new flower-beds made, of new walls built&mdash;of
the sun-dial. I have always wanted to go
there, and some day I shall bundle all these letters
up and pack them in the bottom of a steamer
trunk&mdash;to have a big bonfire with them on the
very same hearth where she burned his."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

<span class="s08">IN THE FIRELIGHT</span></h2>

<p>Again there was a silence, but it was not the
kind of silence that gives consent. On the
other hand his look of severity was positively
discouraging.</p>

<p>"If I may inquire, what do you know about
this place&mdash;this Colmere Abbey?" he finally
asked. "I mean, do you know anything of it in
this century&mdash;whether it's still standing or not&mdash;or
anything at all save what your imagination
pictures?"</p>

<p>It was a rather lawyer-like query, and I shook
my head, feeling somewhat nonplused.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;nothing!"</p>

<p>"Then, if you should go to England, how
would you set about finding out?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that wouldn't be so bad. In fact, I believe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
it would be a unique experience to go
journeying to a spot with nothing more recent
than a Washington Irving sketch as guide-book."</p>

<p>He looked at me half pityingly.</p>

<p>"You might be disappointed," he said gently.
"For my part, I have never taken up a moment's
time mooning about people's ancestral estates&mdash;I've
had too much real work to do&mdash;but I happen
to know that residents often fight shy of tourists."</p>

<p>I had a feeling of ruffled dignity.</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;tourists!" I answered, bridling a
little.</p>

<p>"Because," he hastened to explain, "the owners
of the places can so often afford to live at
home only a short season every year. Many of
them are poor, and the places they own are
mortgaged to the turrets."</p>

<p>"And the shut-up dilapidation would not make
pleasant sight-seeing for rich Americans?"</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"I happen to have heard some such report
about this Colmere Abbey&mdash;years ago," he said.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you sure it was the same place?" I asked,
my heart suddenly bounding. "Colmere, in
Lancashire?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure! I was brought up in Nottingham,
and have heard of the estate, but have
never seen it."</p>

<p>"Then it's still there&mdash;my house of dreams?"</p>

<p>For a moment I waited, palpitatingly, for him
to say more, but he only looked at me musingly,
then back into the fire. After a second he leaned
forward, shaking his unruly hair back, as if he
were trying to rid himself from a haunting
thought.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I can't talk about 'landed gentry,'" he
said, turning to me with a quick fierceness. "I
grow violent when I do! You've no idea how
hateful the whole set is to a man who has had to
make his own way in the world&mdash;against them!"
Then, after this burst of resentment, his mood
seemed to change. "But we must talk about
England," he added, with a hasty gentleness.
"There are so many delightful things we can discuss!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
Tell me, have you been there? Do you
like it?"</p>

<p>I nodded an energetic affirmative.</p>

<p>"I have been there and&mdash;I love it! But it was
a long while ago, and I wasn't old enough to
understand about the things which would interest
me most now."</p>

<p>"A long while ago?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;let me see&mdash;ten years, I believe! At all
events it was the summer after we sold the rosewood
furniture&mdash;and the piano. Mother was so
amazed at herself for having the nerve to part
with the grand piano that she had to take a sea-voyage
to recover herself."</p>

<p>"But what a happy idea!" he commented seriously,
as he looked around. "A grand piano
would really be a nuisance in this cozy room."</p>

<p>For a long time afterward I wondered whether
my very deepest feeling of admiration for him
had been born at the moment I looked at him
first, or when he made this remark. But I've
found it's as hard to ascertain Love's birthday
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
as it is to settle the natal hour of a medieval
author.</p>

<p>"How long have you been in America?" I next
asked, abruptly; and he looked relieved.</p>

<p>"Ten years&mdash;off and on," he answered briskly.
"Most of the time in Pittsburgh, for my grandfather
had chosen that place for me. He would
not have consented to my going back to England
often, if he had lived, but I have been back a
number of times, for I love journeying over the
face of the earth&mdash;and, strange as it may seem,
I love England. Some day&mdash;when things&mdash;when
my affairs&mdash;are in different shape over there I
shall go back to stay."</p>

<p>The tea things were finally arranged by Cicely's
nervous dusky hands, and with a cordial showing
of the letter-but-not-spirit-hospitality, mother appeared,
in the wake of the steaming kettle.</p>

<p>Her expression said more plainly than words
that she would do the decent thing or die.</p>

<p>"I was&mdash;" she began freezingly, as we both
arose to greet her, "I was&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span></p>

<p>She took in at a glance Maitland Tait's gigantic
size, and shrank back&mdash;a little frightened. Then
his good clothes reassured her. A giant who
patronizes a good New York tailor is a <i>cut</i> above
an ordinary giant, she evidently admitted.</p>

<p>"&mdash;detained," she added, with the air of making
a concession. She accepted the chair he drew
up for her, and his down-to-the-belt grace began
making itself conspicuous. She looked him over,
and her jaundiced eye lost something of its color.</p>

<p>"&mdash;<i>unavoidably</i>," she plead, with a regretful
prettiness.</p>

<p>Then she made the tea, and when she saw how
caressingly the big man's smooth brown hands
managed his cup, the remaining thin layer of ice
over her cordiality melted, and she became the
usual charming mother of a marriageable daughter.
While she was at all times absolutely loyal
to Guilford, still she knew that a mother's appearance
is a daughter's asset, and she had always
laid up treasures for me in this manner.</p>

<p>"You were at Mrs. Walker's Flag Day reception
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
yesterday Grace tells me?" she inquired as
casually as if a bloody battle of words had not
been waging over the occurrence all morning.
"And Mrs. Kendall was talking with me this
morning on the telephone about her dance Friday
night&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused, looking at him interrogatively, because
that had been Mrs. Kendall's own emotion
when mentioning the matter.</p>

<p>Mr. Tait glanced toward me.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes&mdash;I had forgotten! You will be
there?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered hastily, and mother came
near scalding the kitten on the rug in the excess
of her surprise. All morning, through the smoke
of battle, I had sent vehement protestations
against having my white tissue redraped for the
occasion, declaring that nothing could induce me
to go.</p>

<p>"I find that one usually goes to no less than
three social affairs on a trip like this&mdash;and I&mdash;well,
I'm afraid I'm rather an unsocial brute! I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
select the biggest things to go to, for one has to
talk less, and there is a better chance of getting
away early," he explained.</p>

<p>Mother left the room soon after this&mdash;the sudden
change of decision about the dance had been
too much for her. Even perfect clothes and
well-bred hands and a graceful waist-line could
not make her forgive this in me. She made a
hasty excuse and left.</p>

<p>Then our two chairs shifted themselves back
into their former positions before the fire and we
talked on in the gloaming. Somehow, since that
outburst of anger against the present-day owners
of Colmere Abbey, the vision of the big man&mdash;the
cave-man&mdash;in the coat of goatskins, with the bare
knees and moccasins, had come back insistently.</p>

<p>Yet it was just a vision, and after a few minutes
it vanished&mdash;after the manner of visions
since the world began. He looked out the window
at the creeping darkness and rose to go.</p>

<p>"Then I'm to see you Friday night?" he asked
at parting.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I'm&mdash;I'm glad."</p>

<p>There had been a green and gold sunset behind
the trees in the park across the way, and after a
moment more he was lost in this weird radiance;
then he suddenly came to view again, in the glow
of electric light at the corner.</p>

<p>A car to the city swung round the curve just
then, and a dark figure, immensely tall in the
shadows, stepped from the pavement. I heard
the conductor ring up a fare&mdash;a harsh metallic
note that indicated <i>finality</i> to me&mdash;then silence.</p>

<p>"He's gone&mdash;gone&mdash;gone!" something sad and
lonesome was saying in my heart. "What if he
should be suddenly called back to Pittsburgh and
I shouldn't see him again?"</p>

<p>To see the very last of him I had dropped
down beside the front door, with my face pressed
against the lace-veiled glass, and so intent was I
upon my task that I had entirely failed to hear
mother's agitated step in the hall above.</p>

<p>I was brought to, however, when I heard the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
click of the electric switch upon the stair. The
lower hall was suddenly flooded with light. I
scrambled to my feet as quickly as I could.
Mother's face, peering at me from the landing,
was already pronouncing sentence.</p>

<p>"Grace, I was just coming down to tell you
that&mdash;well, I am compelled to say that you <i>amaze</i>
me!" she emitted first, with a tone of utter hopelessness
struggling through her newly-fired anger.
"Down on your knees in your new gown&mdash;and
gowns as scarce as angels' visits, too!"</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;but&mdash;I'm sorry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What on earth are you doing there?" she kept
on.</p>

<p>I turned to her, blinking in the dazzling light.</p>

<p>"I was&mdash;let me see?&mdash;oh, <i>yes</i>!" A brilliant
thought had just come to me. "&mdash;I was looking
for the <i>key</i>!"</p>

<p>Now, I happen to hate a liar worse than anything
else on earth, and I hated myself fervently
as I told this one.</p>

<p>"The key?" she asked suspiciously.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span></p>

<p>"It&mdash;it had fallen on the floor," I kept on, for
of course whatever you do you must do with all
your might, as we learn in copy-book days.</p>

<p>"And it never occurred to you to turn on the
light?" she demanded, coming up and looking at
me as if to see the extent of disfigurement this
new malady had wrought. "Down on your
knees searching for a key&mdash;and it never occurred
to you to turn on the light?"</p>

<p>"No," I answered, thankful to be able to tell
the truth again. "No, it never once occurred to
me!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

<span class="s08">TWO MEN AND A MAID</span></h2>

<p>Have you ever thought that the reason we
can so fully sympathize with certain great
people of history, and not with others, is because
we are occasionally granted a glimpse of the
emotion our favorites enjoyed&mdash;or endured?</p>

<p>For instance, no man who has ever knocked
the "t" out of "can't" stands beside Napoleon's
tomb without a sensation which takes the form
of: "<i>We</i> understand each other&mdash;don't we, old
top?"</p>

<p>And every year at spring-time, Romeo is
patted on the back condescendingly by thousands
of youths&mdash;so susceptible that they'd fall in love
with anything whose skirt and waist met in the
back.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span></p>

<p>The night of the Kendalls' dance <i>I</i> knew what
Cleopatra's cosmic consciousness resembled&mdash;exactly.
I knew it from the moment she glanced
away from the glint of her silver oars of the
wonderful Nile barge (because the glint of Antony's
dark eyes was so much more compelling)
to the hour she recklessly unwrapped the basket
of figs in her death chamber! I ran the whole
gamut of her emotions&mdash;'twixt love and duty&mdash;and
I came out of it feeling that&mdash;well, certainly
I felt that a conservatory is a room where eavesdroppers
hear no good of themselves!</p>

<p>"Is everybody crazy to-night?" I whispered
to Guilford, as we paused for a moment before
the dancing commenced just outside one of the
downy, silky reception rooms&mdash;quite apart from
the noisy ballroom farther back&mdash;and I saw two
people inside. The girl was seated before the
piano, and was singing softly, while the man
stood at her side, listening with a rapt expression.</p>

<p>"Who would ever have thought that <i>that</i> girl
would be singing <i>that</i> song to <i>that</i> man?" I asked,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
with a quivery little feeling that the world was
going topsyturvy with other people besides me.
The singer was the careless, rowdy golf champion
of the state, and the man listening was Oldburgh's
astonishing young surgeon&mdash;the kind
who never went anywhere because it was said he
laid aside his scalpel only when he was obliged
to pick up his fork.</p>

<p>"What is the song?" Guilford inquired, looking
in, then drawing back softly and dropping the
curtain that screened the doorway.</p>

<p>"<i>Caro Mio Ben!</i>"</p>

<p>"A love song?"</p>

<p>I smiled.</p>

<p>"Well, rather!"</p>

<p>Then somebody crowded up and separated
Guilford and me. I stood there listening to the
lovely Italian words, and wondering if the night
were in truth bewitched. Guilford, under the
impulse induced by a white tissue gown and big
red roses, had suffered an unusual heart-action
already and had spent half an hour whispering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
things in my ear which made me feel embarrassed
and ashamed. The only thing which can possibly
make a lifelong engagement endurable is
the brotherly attitude assumed by the lover in his
late teens.</p>

<p>"Come in," he said, elbowing his way back to
me through the chattering throng of the autumn's
débutantes, after a few minutes. "I hear the
violins beginning to groan&mdash;and say&mdash;<i>haven't</i>
they got everybody worth having here to-night?"</p>

<p>"I don't&mdash;know," I replied vaguely, looking
up and down the length of the room that we
were entering.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;there's Mrs. Walker, and there are the
Chester girls, and Dan Hunter, just back from
Africa&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Certainly they've got a fine selection of Oldburgh's
solid, rolled-gold ornaments," I commented
dryly, as my eyes searched the other side
of the room.</p>

<p>"Oh, besides local talent in plenty to create
some excitement, there's an assortment of imported
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
artists," he went on. "That French fellow,
d'Osmond, has been teaching some of the
kids a new figure and they're going to try it to-night.
Have you met him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed&mdash;oh, no, of course I haven't met
him, Guilford!" I answered impatiently. "How
could I meet a stray French nobleman? The
society editor is <i>his</i> Boswell."</p>

<p>He turned away, hurt at my show of irritation,
but I didn't care. I was in that reckless mood
that comes during a great fire, or a storm at sea,
or any other catastrophe when the trivialities of
living fade into pygmy proportions before the
vast desire for mere life.</p>

<p>"And there's that Consolidated Traction Company
fellow," he said humbly, calling my attention
to a bunch of new arrivals at the doors of
the ballroom. "What's his name?"</p>

<p>"Maitland Tait."</p>

<p>"Have you met him?" he inquired.</p>

<p>Now usually Guilford is not humble, nor even
very forgiving, so that when he turned to me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
again and showed that he was determined to be
entertaining, I glanced at a mirror we happened
to be passing. How easy it would be to keep
men right where we wanted them if life could
be carried on under frosted lights, in white tissue
gowns, holding big red roses!</p>

<p>"Yes, I've met him," I answered giddily. "He
was at Mrs. Walker's Flag Day reception Tuesday&mdash;and
he brought me to town in his car, then
came calling Wednesday afternoon, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Guilford had stopped still and was looking at
me as if anxious to know when I'd felt the first
symptoms.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's true," I laughed desperately.</p>

<p>"Then why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;that is, you might have mentioned it.
Of course, it really makes no difference&mdash;" He
smiled, dismissing it as a triviality.</p>

<p>Gentle reader, I don't know whether your
sympathies have secretly been with Guilford all
the time or not&mdash;but I know that mine were distinctly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
with him at that moment. If there is
ever a season when a woman's system is predisposed
toward the malady known as sex love, it
is when some man is magnanimous about another
man. And Guilford's manner at that instant was
magnanimous&mdash;and I already had fifty-seven
other varieties of affection for him! I decided
then, in the twinkling of my fan chain, which I
was agitating rather mercilessly, that if Guilford
were the kind of a man I <i>could</i> love, he'd be the
very man I should adore.</p>

<p>&mdash;But he wasn't. And the kind I could love
was disentangling himself from the group around
the door and coming toward me at that very
moment.</p>

<p>"Have you met him?" I asked of my companion,
trying to pretend that the noise was my
fan chain and not my heart.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>In another instant they were shaking hands
cordially.</p>

<p>"You'll excuse me a moment?" Guilford asked,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
turning to me&mdash;after he and Maitland Tait had
propounded and answered perfunctory questions
about Oldburgh. "I wanted to speak to&mdash;Delia
Ramage."</p>

<p>I had never before in my life heard of his
wishing to speak to Delia Ramage, but she was
the nearest one to him, so he veered across to
her side, while I was left alone with the new
arrival. This is called heaping coals of fire.</p>

<p>"I was glad to see you&mdash;a moment ago," Maitland
Tait said in that low intimate tone which
is usually begotten only by daily or hourly
thought. Take two people who have not seen
each other for a week, nor thought of each other,
and when they meet they will shrill out spontaneous,
falsetto tones&mdash;but not so with two people
whose spirits have communed five minutes
before. They lower their voices when they come
face to face, for they realize that they are before
the sanctum. "You're looking most&mdash;unusually
well."</p>

<p>He was not, but I refrained from telling him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
so. Most thoughtful men assume a look of constraint
when they are forced to mingle with a
shallow-pated, boisterous throng, and he was
strictly of this type&mdash;I observed it with a thrill
of triumph.</p>

<p>Yet the festive appearance of evening dress
was not unbecoming to him. His was that kind
of magnificent plainness which showed to advantage
in gala attire, and I knew that even if I
could get him off to live the life of a cave-man,
occasionally a processional of the tribe would
cause him to thrust brilliant feathers into his
goatskin cap and bind his sandals with gleaming
new thongs. But then the martial excitement of
a processional would cause his eyes to light up
with a brilliancy to match the feathers in his cap,
and a dance could not do this.</p>

<p>"Of course you're engaged for the first
dance?" he asked, as the music began and a general
commotion ensued. "I knew that I'd have
to miss that&mdash;when I was late. But"&mdash;he came
a step closer and spoke as if acting under some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
hasty impulse&mdash;"I want to tell you how very
lovely I think you are to-night! I hope you do
not mind my saying this? I didn't know it before&mdash;I
thought it was due to other influences&mdash;but
you are beautiful."</p>

<p>It was at this moment that the silver oars of
the Nile barge were dimmed under the greater
resplendence of dark eyes&mdash;and the purple silk
sails closed out the sky, but closed in heaven.
Cleopatra and I might have cut our teeth on the
same coral ring, for all the inferiority <i>I</i> felt to
her in that instant.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'm afraid&mdash;" I began palpitatingly, for
you must know that palpitations are part of the
Egyptian rôle&mdash;the sense of danger and wrong
were what raised&mdash;or lowered&mdash;the flitting space
of time out of the ordinary lover thrills. "I am
afraid&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you must not say that!" he commanded,
his deep voice muffled. "This is just the beginning
of what I wish to say to you."</p>

<p>I wrenched my eyes away from his&mdash;then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
looked quickly for Guilford. Grandfather
Moore's warnings in my ear were choking the
violin music into demoniac howls. I don't believe
that any woman ever really enjoys having
two men love her at the same time&mdash;and this is
not contradicting what I've said in the above
paragraph about Cleopatra. I never once said
that I had <i>enjoyed</i> feeling like her&mdash;you simply
took it for granted that I had!</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to dance&mdash;with some one?"
I asked, turning back quickly, as Guilford's arm
slipped about me and we started away into a
heartless, senseless motion. Maitland Tait stood
looking at me for an instant without answering,
then swept his eyes down the room to where
Mrs. Charles Sefton&mdash;a sister-in-law of the
house of Kendall&mdash;and her daughter Anabel were
standing. Mrs. Sefton was a pillar of society,
and, if one <i>must</i> use architectural similes, Anabel
was a block. They caught him and made a sandwich
of him on the spot. I whirled away with
Guilford.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span></p>

<p>At the end of the dance I found myself at the
far end of the ballroom, close to a door that
opened into a small conservatory. The dim green
within looked so calm and uncomplicated beside
the glare of light which surrounded me that I
turned toward it&mdash;thirstily.</p>

<p>"I'm going in here to rest a minute, Guilford,"
I explained, setting him free with a little push
toward a group of girls he knew. "You run
along and dance with some of them. Men aren't
any too plentiful to-night."</p>

<p>"No-o&mdash;I'll go with you," he objected lazily,
slipping his cigarette case from his pocket.
"You're too darned pretty to-night to stay long
in a conservatory alone."</p>

<p>"But I'll not be alone," I replied, with a return
of that frightful recklessness which tempted me
to throw myself on his mercy and say: "I'm in
love with this Englishman&mdash;madly in love! I
have never been in love before&mdash;and I hope I
shall never be again if it always feels like this!"
Instead of saying this, however, I said, with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
smile: "Don't think for a moment that I shall
be alone. Grandfather and Uncle Lancelot will
be with me."</p>

<p>He looked disgusted.</p>

<p>"What's going on in your conscience now?"
he asked, with slightly primped lips.</p>

<p>"Something&mdash;that I'll tell you about later."</p>

<p>"But has it got to be threshed out to-night?"
he demanded irritably. "I had hoped that we
might spend this one evening acting like human
beings."</p>

<p>"Still, it seems that we can't," I answered, with
a foolish attempt to sound inconsequential.
"Please let me sit down in here by myself for a
little while, Guilford."</p>

<p>He turned on his heel, with an unflattering
abruptness, and left me. I entered the damp,
earthy-smelling room, where wicker tables held
giant ferns, and a fountain drizzling sleepily in
the center of the apartment, broke off the view
of a green cane bench just beyond; I made for
this settee and sank down dejectedly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span></p>

<p>How long I sat there I could not tell&mdash;one
never can, if you've noticed&mdash;but after a little
while I heard the next dance start, and then
three people, still in the position of a sandwich,
entered.</p>

<p>"How warm it is to-night!" I heard Maitland
Tait's voice suddenly proclaim, in a fretful tone,
as if the women with him were responsible for
the disagreeable fact. But he drew up a chair,
rather meekly, and subsided into it. "This is the
first really warm night we've had this summer."</p>

<p>"It seems like the irony of fate, doesn't it?"
Anabel Sefton asked with a nervous little giggle.
There are some girls who can never talk to a man
five minutes without bringing fate's name into
the conversation.</p>

<p>"We had almost no dances during April and
May, when one really needed violence of some
sort to keep warm," her mother hastened to explain.
"And now, at this last dance of the season,
it is actually hot."</p>

<p>"The last big dance, mother."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course!" Mrs. Sefton leaned toward the
other two chairs confidentially. "A crush like
this is too big," she declared.</p>

<p>"Oh, but I like the big affairs," Anabel pouted.
"You never know then who you're going to run
across! Just think of the unfamiliar faces here
to-night! I happened up on Gayle Cargill and
Doctor Macdonald down in the drawing-room a
while ago&mdash;where they'd hidden to sing Italian,
sotto voce!"</p>

<p>"Then Dan Hunter is here&mdash;for a wonder,"
her mother agreed, as if a recital of Oldburgh's
submerged tenth were quite the most interesting
thing she could think up for a foreigner's delectation,
"and Grace Christie! Have you met Miss
Christie, Mr. Tait?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied.</p>

<p>"She's gone in for newspaper work," Anabel
elucidated.</p>

<p>"Just a pose," her mother hastily added. "She
really belongs to one of our best families, and is
engaged to Guilford Blake."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span></p>

<p>"But she won't marry him," Anabel said
virtuously. "I'm sure <i>I</i> can't understand such
a nature. They've been engaged all their lives
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She doesn't deserve anything better than to
lose him," her mother broke in. "If he should
chance to look in some other direction for a while
she'd change her tactics, no doubt."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;no doubt," echoed a deep male voice,
the tones as cool as the water-drops plashing into
the fountain beside him.</p>

<p>"Anyway, it's her kind&mdash;those women who
would be sirens if the mythological age hadn't
passed&mdash;who cause so much trouble in the world,"
Mrs. Sefton wound up. At fifty-two women can
look upon sirens dispassionately.</p>

<p>After a while the music began throbbing again,
and a college boy came up to claim Anabel. The
trio melted quietly away. I rose from my chair
and started toward the door when I saw that
Maitland Tait had not left with the others. He
was standing motionless beside the fountain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span></p>

<p>I came up with him and he did not start. Evidently
he had known all the while that I was in
the room.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said, with a certain aloofness that
strangely enough gave him the appearance of intense
aristocracy. "Well?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" I echoed, feebly, but before I could
go away farther he had drawn himself up sharply.</p>

<p>"I was coming to look for you&mdash;to say good-by,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Good-by?" I repeated blankly. "You mean
good night, don't you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Our eyes met squarely then, and mine dropped.
They had hit against steel.</p>

<p>"And this is&mdash;good-by?" I plead, while I felt
that wild wind and waves were beating against
my body and that the skies were falling.</p>

<p>"Of course!" he answered harshly. "What
else could it be?"</p>

<p>I think that we must have stood there in silence
for a minute or more, then, without speaking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
another word, or even looking at me squarely in
the face again, he moved deliberately away and I
lost all trace of him in the crowd.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

<span class="s08">AN ASSIGNMENT</span></h2>

<p>The next afternoon the city editor again said
"Damn" and blushed.</p>

<p>"You needn't blush," I said to him wearily.</p>

<p>He glanced around in surprise.</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>"No! I quite agree with you!"</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon, but I made no
apology for my tardiness, as I hung my hat on its
nail and started toward my desk.</p>

<p>"Oh, you feel like saying it yourself, eh?" he
questioned.</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>He turned then and looked at me squarely. It
was very seldom that he did such a thing, and as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
some time had elapsed since his last look he was
likely able to detect a subtle change in my face.</p>

<p>"What's wrong with you?" he asked gruffly.
"If you had <i>my</i> job, now, there'd be something
to worry over! What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>He turned away, precipitately.</p>

<p>"Gee! Let me get out of here! That's what
women always say when they're getting ready to
cry."</p>

<p>"But I'm not going to cry!" I assured him, as
he dashed through the doorway and I turned with
some relief to my desk, for talking was somewhat
of an effort.</p>

<p>I raised the top, whistling softly&mdash;one can
nearly <i>always</i> manage a little sizzling whistle&mdash;then
shrank back in terror from what I saw there.&mdash;Such
chaos as must have been scattered about
before sunrise on the morning of the First Day!
Was it possible that I had been excited yesterday
to the point of leaving the mucilage bottle unstopped?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span></p>

<p>I set to work, however, with a little sickening
sense of shame, to making right the ravages that
had taken place.</p>

<p>"A woman may fashion her balloon of anticipation
out of silver tissue&mdash;but her parachute is
<i>always</i> made of sack-cloth!" I groaned.</p>

<p>My desk was really in the wildest disorder.
The tin top of the mucilage bottle had disappeared,
the bottle had been overturned, its contents
had been lavished upon the devoted head of a
militant suffragette, and she was pinioned tightly
to my blotting-pad.</p>

<p>"The elevator to Success is not running&mdash;take
the stairs," grinned a framed motto above the
desk.</p>

<p>"You take a&mdash;back seat!" I said, jumping up
and turning the thing to the wall. "What do I
care about success, if it's the sort of thing connected
with typewriters, offices, copy paper and a
pot of paste? I'm&mdash;I'm <i>des-qua-mat-ing</i>!"</p>

<p>Never before in my experience had the life of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
journalistic devotion looked quite so black as the
ink that accompanies it.</p>

<p>"Mottoes about success ought to belong to men,
anyhow!" I said again, looking up furiously at
the drab back of the frame. "I'm not a man,
nor cut out for man's work. I'm just a woman,
and my head aches!"</p>

<p>I looked again at the militant suffragette, for it
was a tragedy to me. I had spent a week of time
and five honest dollars in the effort to get that
photograph from a New York studio. She wasn't
any common suffragette, but a strict head-liner.</p>

<p>"I'm not even a woman&mdash;I'm a child to let a
little thing like this upset me," I was deciding a
while later, when the door of the room opened
again and some one entered.</p>

<p>"You're a big baby!" the city editor pronounced
disgustedly, coming up to my desk and
lowering his voice. "I knew you were going to
cry."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I think I may be coming down with typhoid,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
I said coldly, to keep from encouraging
him in conversation. "And I've got a terrible lot
of work to do before it gets quite dark. Really,
an awful lot."</p>

<p>He dropped back a few paces, then circled
nearer once more.</p>

<p>"Got anything&mdash;special?" he asked aimlessly.</p>

<p>His manner was so entirely inconsequential
that I knew he had the most important thing for
a month up his sleeve.</p>

<p>"Do you call this&mdash;mess anything special?" I
asked. "I've got to do a general house-cleaning,
and I wish I had a vacuum machine that would
suck the whole business up into its mouth, swallow
it and digest it&mdash;so I'd never see a scrap of it
again."</p>

<p>Have I said before that he was a middle-aged
man, named Hudson, and had scant red hair? It
doesn't make any special difference about his
looks, since I hadn't taken any rash vow to marry
the first unfortunate man who crossed my path,
but he looked so ludicrously insignificant and unlike
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
an instrument of fate as he stood there, trying
to break the news to me by degrees.</p>

<p>"Hate your ordinary work this afternoon?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I hate everything."</p>

<p>"Then, how would you like to change off a
little?"</p>

<p>"I'd like to change off from breathing&mdash;if that
would accommodate you any," I replied.</p>

<p>He made a "tut-tut" admonition with the tip of
his tongue.</p>

<p>"You might not find blowing red-hot coals any
pleasanter," he warned, "and angry little girls like
you can't hope to go to heaven when they die!"</p>

<p>I rose, with a great effort after professional
dignity.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hudson, evidently you have an assignment
for me," I said. "Will you be so good as to
let me know what it is?"</p>

<p>But even then he looked for a full thirty seconds
into the luscious doors of a fruit stand across
the street.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span></p>

<p>"I want <i>you</i> to get&mdash;that Consolidated Traction
Company story for me," he then declared.</p>

<p>I jumped back as I had never jumped but once
in my life before&mdash;the time when Aunt Patricia
announced that she was going to leave James
Christie's love-letters to me.</p>

<p>"You were at that dance last night!" I cried
out accusingly, then realizing the absurdity of this
I began stammering. "I mean, that I'm a special
feature writer!" I kept on before he had had time
to send me more than a demon's grin of comprehension.</p>

<p>"You are and this story is devilish special," he
returned. "I want you to get it."</p>

<p>His tone, which all of a sudden was the boiled-down
essence of business, sent me in a tremor
over toward the nail where my hat hung. It was
getting dark and I remembered then that I had
heard fragments of telephonic conversation earlier
in the evening anent "catching him there about
seven."</p>

<p>"Well?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span></p>

<p>He looked at me&mdash;with almost a human expression.</p>

<p>"I wasn't at the ball last night&mdash;but grapevines
have been rustling, I admit," he said. "I
hate like the very devil to ask you to do it, if you
want to know the truth, but there's no other way
out. I hope you believe me."</p>

<p>"A city editor doesn't have to be believed, but
has to be obeyed," I responded, rising again from
my chair where I had dropped to lock my desk.
"Now, what is it I must do?"</p>

<p>"Well, I have a hunch that you will succeed
where Clemons and Bolton and Reade have
failed," he said. "And the foolish way the fellow
acts makes it necessary for us to use all haste
and strategy!"</p>

<p>"The fellow?"</p>

<p>"Maitland Tait. A day or two ago it was understood
that he might remain in this town for
several days longer&mdash;then to-day comes the news
that he's straining every nerve to get away to-morrow!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, to-morrow!"</p>

<p>"It appears that all the smoke in Pittsburgh is
curling up into question marks to find out when
he's coming back&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's so important?"</p>

<p>"Exactly! But to-night he's going to hold a
final conference at Loomis, and you can catch him
before time for this if you'll go right on now."</p>

<p>"Very well," I answered, feeling myself in profound
hypnosis.</p>

<p>"And, say! You'll have to hurry," he said,
pressing the advantage my quiet demeanor offered.
"Here! Take this hunk o' copy paper
and hike!"</p>

<p>I accepted the proffered paper, still hypnotized,
then when I had reached the door I stopped.</p>

<p>"Understand, Mr. Hudson, I'm doing this because
you have assigned it to me!" I said with a
cutting severity. "Please let that be perfectly
plain! I shouldn't go a step toward Loomis&mdash;not
even if it were a matter of life and death&mdash;if
it were <i>not</i> a matter of urgent business!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span></p>

<p>He looked at me blankly for a moment, then
grinned. Afterward I realized that he knew this
declaration was being made to my own inner consciousness,
and not to him.</p>

<p>"Don't ask him for a photograph&mdash;for God's
sake!" he called after me, from the head of the
steps. "Remember&mdash;you're going out there on
the <i>Herald's</i> account and the <i>Herald</i> doesn't need
his picture, because it happens that we've already
got a dandy one of him!"</p>

<p>I turned back fiercely.</p>

<p>"I hadn't <i>dreamed</i> of asking him for his photograph!"
I fired. "I hope I have some vestige of
reasoning power left!"</p>

<p>At the corner a car to Loomis was passing, and
once inside I inspected every passenger in the
deadly fear of seeing some one whom I knew.
There was no one there, however, who could later
be placed on the witness-stand against me, so I
sat down and watched the town outside speeding
by&mdash;first the busy up-town portion, then the heavy
wholesale district, with its barrels tumbling out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
of wagon ends and its mingled odor of fruit,
vinegar and molasses, combined with soap and
tanned hides. After this the river was crossed,
we sped through a suburban settlement, out into
the open country, then nearer and nearer and
nearer.</p>

<p>All the time I sat like one paralyzed. I hated
intensely the thought of going out there, but the
very speed of the car seemed to furnish excuse
enough for me not to get off! I didn't have will
power enough to push the bell, so when the greasy
terminal of the line was reached I rose quietly
and left the car along with a number of men in
overalls and a bevy of tired dejected-looking
women.</p>

<p>"They ought to call it 'Gloom-is,'" I muttered,
as I alighted at the little wooden station, where
one small, yellow incandescent light showed you
just how dark and desolate the place was. "And
these people live here!&mdash;I'll never say a word
against West Clydemont Place again as long as
I live!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span></p>

<p>Without seeming to notice the gloom, the people
who had come out on the car with me dispersed
in different directions, two or three of the
men making first for the shadow of a big brick
building which stood towering blackly a little distance
up from the car tracks. I followed after
them, then stopped before a lighted door at this
building while they disappeared into a giant
round-house farther back. The whir of machinery
was steady and monotonous, and it served to
drown out the noise my heart was making, for I
was legitimately frightened, even in my reportorial
capacity, as well as being embarrassed and
ashamed, independent of the <i>Herald</i>. It was a
most unpleasant moment.</p>

<p>"This must be the office!"</p>

<p>The big door was slightly ajar, so I entered,
rapping with unsteady knuckles a moment later
against the forbidding panels of another door
marked "Private."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Well" is only a tolerant word at best&mdash;never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
encouraging&mdash;and now it sounded very much like
"Go to the devil!"</p>

<p>"I don't give a rap if he <i>is</i> the Vice-President
and General Manager of the Consolidated Traction
Company," I muttered, the capital letters of
his position and big corporation, however, pelting
like giant hailstones against my courage. "I'm
Special Feature Writer for <i>The Oldburgh Herald</i>!"</p>

<p>"If you've got any business with me open that
door and come in!" was the further invitation I
received. "If you haven't, go on off!"</p>

<p>The invitation wasn't exactly pressing in its
tone, but I managed to nerve myself up to accepting
it.</p>

<p>"But I have got some&mdash;business with you!" I
gasped, as I opened the door.</p>

<p>Mr. Tait turned around from his desk&mdash;a
worse-looking desk by far than the one I had left
at the <i>Herald</i> office.</p>

<p>"Good lord&mdash;that is, I mean to say, <i>dear</i> me!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
he muttered, as he wheeled and saw me. "Miss
Christie!"</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_211.jpg" width="342" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption">"This must be the office"</p>
</div>

<p>"Are you so surprised&mdash;then?"</p>

<p>"Surprised? Of course, a little, but&mdash;no-o, not
so much either, when you come to think of it!"</p>

<p>The room was bare and barn-like, with a
couple of shining desks, and half a dozen chairs.
A calendar, showing a red-gowned lady, who in
turn was showing her knees, hung against the opposite
wall. Mr. Tait drew up one of the chairs.</p>

<p>"Thank you&mdash;though I haven't a minute to
stay!"</p>

<p>I stammered a little, then sat down and scrambled
about in my bag for a small fan I always
carried.</p>

<p>"A minute?"</p>

<p>"Not long, really&mdash;for it's getting late, you
see!"</p>

<p>My fingers were twitching nervously with the
fan, trying to stuff it back into the bag and hide
that miserable copy paper which had sprung out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
of its lair like a "jack-in-the-box" at the opening
of the clasp.</p>

<p>He smiled&mdash;so silently and persistently that I
was constrained to look up and catch it. He had
seemed not to observe the copy paper.</p>

<p>"If you're in such a hurry your '<i>business</i>' must
be urgent," he said, and his tone was full of satire.</p>

<p>"It is, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>I looked at him again, then hesitated, my voice
breaking suddenly. Somehow, I felt that I was
a thousand miles away from that magic spot on
the Nile where the evening before had placed me.
He looked so different!</p>

<p>"You needn't rub it in on me!" I flashed back
at him.</p>

<p>His chair was tilted slightly against the desk,
and he sat there observing me impersonally as if
I were a wasp pinned on a cardboard. He was
looking aloof and keenly aristocratic&mdash;as he was
at the entrance of the conservatory the evening
before.</p>

<p>"Rub it in on you?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span></p>

<p>"I mean that I didn't want to come out here
to-night!"</p>

<p>My face was growing hot, and try as I would
to keep my eyes dry and professional-looking
something sprang up and glittered so bewilderingly
that as I turned away toward the lady on
the calendar, she looked like a dozen ladies&mdash;all
of them doing the hesitation waltz.</p>

<p>He straightened up in his chair, relieving that
impertinent tilt.</p>

<p>"Oh,&mdash;you didn't want to come?"</p>

<p>"Of course not!"</p>

<p>I blinked decisively&mdash;and the red-gowned one
faded back to her normal number, but my eyelids
were heavy and wet still.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please don't think that I came out here to-night
because I wanted to see you, Mr. Tait!" I
was starting to explain, when he interrupted me,
the satire quite gone.</p>

<p>"But, after all, what else was there to do?" he
asked, with surprising gentleness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span></p>

<p>"What else?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Certainly it was <i>your</i> next move,&mdash;Grace!"</p>

<p>My heart out-did the machinery in the round-house
in the way of making a hubbub at that instant,
but he seemed not to hear.</p>

<p>"I mean to say&mdash;I&mdash;I expected to hear from
you in some manner to-day. That is, I <i>hoped</i> to
hear."</p>

<p>I gave a hysterical laugh.</p>

<p>"But you didn't expect me to board a trolley-car
and run you down after night in your own
den&mdash;surely?" I demanded.</p>

<p>He half rose from his chair, hushing my mocking
word with a gesture. His manner was chivalrously
protecting.</p>

<p>"You shan't talk that way about yourself!" he
said insistently. "Whatever you have chosen to
do is&mdash;is&mdash;all right!"</p>

<p>I felt bewildered.</p>

<p>"I just wanted to let you know&mdash;" I began,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
when he stopped me again, this time with an air
of finality.</p>

<p>"Please don't waste this <i>dear</i> little hour in explaining!"
he begged. "I want you to know&mdash;to
feel absolutely that nothing you might ever do
could be misunderstood by me! I feel now that I
<i>know</i> you&mdash;your impulsive, headstrong ways&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Heart-strong,' Aunt Patricia used to say,"
I modified softly.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;'heart-strong!' I understand you!
I understand why you refrained from telling me
of your engagement, even."</p>

<p>My eyes dropped.</p>

<p>"I didn't&mdash;know then."</p>

<p>"You didn't know how I felt&mdash;what an unhappy
complication you were stirring up."</p>

<p>There was a tense little silence, then he spoke
again.</p>

<p>"If you are not in love with your fiancé&mdash;never
have been in love with him&mdash;why do you maintain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
the relationship?" he asked, in as careful and
businesslike a manner as if he were inquiring the
price of pig-iron.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;because that's the way we do things
down here in this state," I answered. "What
we <i>never</i> have done before, we have a hard time
starting&mdash;and mother idolizes him!"</p>

<p>He smiled&mdash;his own particular brand of smile&mdash;for
the first time.</p>

<p>"Little&mdash;goose!" he said.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;last night, when you pretended that
you were going straight away&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> going away," he broke in with considerable
dignity. "That is, I have my plans laid
that way now."</p>

<p>"Plans?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It's true that my resolution to get away
from this town was born rather precipitately last
night; however, I have been able to make my
plans coincide."</p>

<p>"Oh!" I began with a foolish little quiver in
my voice, then collected myself. "I'm glad that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
you could arrange your affairs so satisfactorily."</p>

<p>He looked across at me, his mouth grim.</p>

<p>"Why should I stay?" he demanded. "To-night
will see the finishing up of the business
which brought me to Oldburgh!"</p>

<p>Then, and not until then, I'm afraid, did I
really recall the face of my city editor&mdash;and the
fact that he had sent me out to obtain an interview,
not a proposal.</p>

<p>"Your business with the Macdermott Realty
Company?" I inquired.</p>

<p>Maitland Tait looked at me with an amused
smile.</p>

<p>"What do you know about that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing except what all the world knows!"</p>

<p>I managed to inject some hurt feeling into my
voice, as if I had a right to know more, which in
truth I felt.</p>

<p>"And how much does the world know?"</p>

<p>"Merely that you've either planned to shut
down this plant here and move the whole business
to Birmingham, or you've bought up acres and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
acres more of Oldburgh's suburbs and will make
this spot so important and permanent that the
company's grandchildren will have to call it
home."</p>

<p>"But you&mdash;<i>you</i> don't know which I've done,
eh?"</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>"Then shall I tell you? Are you interested?"</p>

<p>"I'm certainly interested in knowing whether
or not you'll&mdash;ever come back to Oldburgh&mdash;but
I don't want you to tell <i>me</i> anything you'd rather
I shouldn't know."</p>

<p>"I believe I want to tell you," he replied, his
face softening humorously. "We have bought
acres and acres more of Oldburgh's suburbs, and
we're going to have quite a little city out here!"</p>

<p>"There's room for improvement," I observed,
looking out through the window into the greasy
darkness.</p>

<p>"There is and I'm going to see to it that the
improvement's made! There will be model cottages
here in place of those miserable hovels that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
I'm glad you can't see from here to-night&mdash;and
each cottage will have its garden spot&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's good!" I approved. "I love gardens."</p>

<p>"Wait until you see some English ones I have
seen," he said patriotically.</p>

<p>"I shall&mdash;then pattern my own by them! But&mdash;these
Loomis plans?"</p>

<p>"Model cottages, with gardens&mdash;then a schoolhouse,
with well-kept grounds&mdash;a club-room for
men&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And a <i>sewing</i> circle for their wives," I added
contemptuously.</p>

<p>He looked taken aback.</p>

<p>"Don't you like that?" he asked anxiously.
"Why shouldn't they sew?"</p>

<p>"But why should they&mdash;just because they're
women?" I asked in answer, and after a moment
he began to see light.</p>

<p>"Of course if you prefer having them write
novels, model in clay and illumine parchments
we'll add those departments," he declared, with a
generous air. "We're determined to have everything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
that an altruistic age has thrust upon the
manufacturer to reduce his net income."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;occasionally&mdash;<i>you'll</i> be coming back to
Oldburgh to see that the gardens grow silver bells
and cockle shells and pretty maids all in a row?"
I suggested, but after a momentary smile his face
sobered.</p>

<p>"I don't know! There are things&mdash;in England&mdash;that
complicate any arrangements, I mean <i>business</i>
arrangements, I might wish to make just
now."</p>

<p>"And Loomis will have to get along without
you?"</p>

<p>I had put the question idly, with no ulterior
motive in the world, but he leaned forward until
the arm of his revolving chair scraped against my
chair.</p>

<p>"Loomis <i>can</i> get along without me," he said,
in a low tone, "and therefore must&mdash;but if I
should find that I am needed&mdash;<i>wanted</i> here in
Oldburgh&mdash;"</p>

<p>The shriek of the city-bound trolley-car broke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
in at that instant upon the quiet of the room, interrupting
his slow tense words; and I sprang up
and crossed to the window, for I felt suddenly a
wild distaste to having Maitland Tait say important
things to me then and there! Something in
me demanded the most beautiful setting the world
could afford for what he was going to say!</p>

<p>"I ought&mdash;I ought to catch that car!"</p>

<p>He followed me, his face gravely wondering.</p>

<p>"My motor is here. I'll take you back to
town," he said, looking over my shoulder into the
noisy, dimly-lit scene.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;weren't you going to be busy out here
this evening?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;later. I'll go with you, then return to a
meeting I have here."</p>

<p>He rang the bell beside his desk and a moment
later the face of Collins appeared in the doorway.
Outside the limousine was breathing softly.</p>

<p>I don't remember what we talked about going
in to town, or whether we talked at all or not; but
when the machine slowed up at the <i>Herald</i> building
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
and Maitland Tait helped me out, there was
the same light shining from his eyes that shone
there the night before&mdash;the light that made the
glint of the silver oars on Cleopatra's Nile barge
turn pale&mdash;and the radiance half blinded me.</p>

<p>"Grace, you don't want me to say anything to-night&mdash;I
can see that," he said. "And you are
right&mdash;if you are still bound to that other man!
I can say nothing until I know you are free&mdash;"</p>

<p>He whispered the words, our hands meeting
warmly.</p>

<p>"But, if you are going away!&mdash;You'll come and
say good-by?"</p>

<p>"If it's to say good-by there'll be no use coming,"
he answered. "You <i>know</i> how I feel!"</p>

<p>"But we must say good-by!" I plead.</p>

<p>He leaned forward then, as he made a motion
to step back into the car. His eyes were passionate.</p>

<p>"What matters where good-by is said&mdash;if we
can do nothing but say it?" he demanded. "It's
<i>your</i> next move, Grace."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<span class="s08">JILTED!</span></h2>

<p>When a tempest in a teapot goes out at the
spout it is always disappointing to spectators!</p>

<p>One naturally expects the vessel to burst&mdash;or
the lid to fly off, at least&mdash;and when neither takes
place one experiences a little collapsed feeling of
disappointment.</p>

<p>The barest thought of the pain I was going to
inflict upon Guilford Blake when I broke my lifelong
engagement to him had been sending shivers
up and down my backbone ever since four o'clock
on the afternoon of Mrs. Hiram Walker's reception&mdash;<i>then</i>,
when I turned away from Maitland
Tait's motor-car the night I went to Loomis on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
urgent business, and came face to face with my
betrothed standing in the shadow of the office
door waiting for me&mdash;the unexpected happened!</p>

<p>Mr. Blake broke his engagement with me!</p>

<p>"Grace, you amaze me!" he said.</p>

<p>He said it so quietly, with so icy an air of disapproval
that I looked up quickly to see what the
trouble was. Then I observed that he had told
the truth. I hadn't crushed, wounded, nor annihilated
him. I had simply amazed him.</p>

<p>"Oh, Guilford! I didn't know you were here!"</p>

<p>"I suppose not."</p>

<p>"But, how does it happen&mdash;?"</p>

<p>He motioned me to silence.</p>

<p>"Have the goodness to let me ask the questions,"
he suggested.</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly!"</p>

<p>"Will you, first of all, tell me what this means?"
was the opening query, but before I could reply
he went on: "Not that <i>I</i> have any right to pry
into your affairs, understand!"</p>

<p>"Guilford!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span></p>

<p>"It's true! My right to question you has
ceased to exist!"</p>

<p>"You mean that you have washed your hands
of me?" I gasped. After all, it was most unusual
for Guilford and me to be talking to each other
like this. I was bewildered by the novelty of it.</p>

<p>He caught the sound of the gasp and interpreted
it as a plea for quarter. It settled him in
his determination.</p>

<p>"I must," he declared.</p>

<p>"By all means&mdash;if that's the way you feel
about it," I said courteously, as if granting a request.</p>

<p>He looked down at me, in a manner that said:
"It hurts me more than it does you, my child."</p>

<p>"I've endured&mdash;things from you before this,
Grace," he reminded me, "But to-night&mdash;why,
this out-Herods-Herod!"</p>

<p>Now, if he had looked hurt&mdash;cruelly wounded
or deeply shocked&mdash;I'd have been penitent enough
to behave decently to him. But he didn't. He
was simply angry. He looked like the giant when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
he was searching around for Jack and saying:
"Fee! Faw! Fum! I smell the blood of an Englishman!"</p>

<p>"But what have I done?" I demanded indignantly.
"Mayn't a man come to see me, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Certainly he may!"</p>

<p>"And mayn't I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you may go to see him, too&mdash;if you like!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean&mdash;I mean," he answered, stammering
a little with wrath, "of course <i>you</i> may do such
things&mdash;Grace Christie may&mdash;but my future wife
may not."</p>

<p>For a moment I had a blinded angry paralysis
descend upon me. I had a great desire to do
something to relieve the situation, but I didn't
know what to do&mdash;rather as you feel sometimes
at the breakfast table when your morning grapefruit
hits you squarely in the eye.</p>

<p>"Suppose you try to calm yourself a little and
tell me just what the trouble is," I said, struggling
after calmness for my own individual use.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span></p>

<p>He took off his hat and mopped his brow.</p>

<p>"Your mother suspected last night that something
had gone wrong with you at that dance,"
he began explaining, the flash of the street light
at the corner showing that he had gone quite pale.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"She said that you came in looking wild-eyed
and desperate."</p>

<p>"I am not willing to admit that," I said with
dignity.</p>

<p>"And, then she knew you didn't sleep!" he
kept on. "All day she has been feeling that something
was amiss with you."</p>

<p>"I see! And when I didn't show up to-night
at dinner&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She called the office&mdash;naturally."</p>

<p>"Naturally!" I encouraged.</p>

<p>"And the fool who answered the telephone
consoled her by telling her that you had&mdash;gone&mdash;out&mdash;to&mdash;<i>Loomis</i>!"</p>

<p>He paused dramatically, but I failed to applaud.</p>

<p>"Well, what next?" I inquired casually.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span></p>

<p>He drew back.</p>

<p>"Then you don't deny it?"</p>

<p>I gave a little laugh.</p>

<p>"Why should I attempt to deny it?" I asked.
"Haven't you just caught me in the act of coming
back in Mr. Tait's car?"</p>

<p>"I have!" he answered in gloating triumph,
"that is, I have caught you leaving his car&mdash;while
he made love to you at the curb! This, however,
doesn't necessarily confirm the Loomis rumor!"</p>

<p>He waited for me to explain further, but I
simply bowed my head in acquiescence.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said serenely. "He was making love
to me."</p>

<p>"And you acknowledge this, too?"</p>

<p>I made a gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>"I acknowledge everything, Guilford!&mdash;That
you and I have been the victims of heredity, first
of all, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>He drew back stiffly.</p>

<p>"Victims? I beg pardon?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span></p>

<p>"I mean in this engagement of ours&mdash;that we
had nothing to do with!"</p>

<p>"But I assure you that I have never looked
upon myself in the light of a victim!" he said
proudly. "And&mdash;although I know that it will not
interest you especially&mdash;I wish to add that I have
never given a serious thought to any other woman
in my life."</p>

<p>"Yet you have never been in love with me!" I
challenged.</p>

<p>He hesitated.</p>

<p>"I have always felt very close to you," he endeavored
to explain. "We have so many things
in common&mdash;there is, of course, a peculiar congeniality&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Congeniality?"</p>

<p>It struck me that the only point of congeniality
between us was that we were both Caucasians, but
I didn't say it.</p>

<p>"Our parents were friends long before we were
born! This, of itself, certainly must bring in its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
wake a degree of mutual affection," he explained,
and as the words "mutual affection" came unfeelingly
from his lips I suddenly felt a thousand
years further advanced in wisdom than he.</p>

<p>"But real love may be&mdash;is, I'm sure&mdash;a vastly
different thing from the regard we've had for
each other," I ventured, trying not to make a display
of my superiority in learning, but he interrupted
me contemptuously.</p>

<p>"'Real love!' What could you possibly know
about that?" he asked chillingly. "You, who are
ready to flirt with any stray foreigner who
chances to stop over in this city for a week! But
for me&mdash;why, I have never glanced at another
woman! I have always understood my good fortune
in being affianced to the one woman in the
whole country round who was best fitted to bear
the honored name which has descended to me."</p>

<p>When he said this I began to feel sorry for him.
I was not sorry for his disappointment, you understand,
but for his view-point. "I was never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
fitted for it, Guilford!" I said humbly. "It's true
I come of the same sort of stock that produced
you&mdash;but I am awkwardly grafted on my family
tree! At heart I am a barbarian."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean&mdash;the things you love most I simply
forget about."</p>

<p>"I think you do!" he coincided heartily. "You
have certainly forgotten all about ordinary propriety
to-night."</p>

<p>At this I waxed furious again.</p>

<p>"How I hate that word propriety!" I said.
"And there's another one&mdash;a companion word
which I never mean to use until I'm past sixty!
It's <i>Platonic</i>!&mdash;Those two words remind me of
tarpaulins in a smuggler's boat because you can
hide so much underneath them!"</p>

<p>"I'm not speaking of hiding things," he fired
back, as angry as I was. "And, if you want to
know the truth, I rather admire your honesty in
not trying to pretend that your flirtation with this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
Englishman <i>is</i> Platonic!&mdash;Yet that certainly
doesn't throw any more agreeable light upon this
happening to-night.&mdash;You <i>did</i> go to Loomis!"</p>

<p>I could scarcely keep from laughing at this,
for his anger seemed to be centered in one spot&mdash;like
an alderman's avoirdupois! He was thinking
far less of losing me than of the indelicacy
of my going to Loomis.</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered, trying to make my words
inconsequential. "Old man Hudson sent me!"</p>

<p>His hat, which he had held deferentially in his
hand all this time, suddenly fluttered to the
ground.</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"Didn't you and mother <i>know</i> that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"That&mdash;that it was a business proposition?" he
panted.</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;or I should never have gone! How
little you and mother know about me, after all,
Guilford."</p>

<p>He looked crestfallen for a moment, then his
face brightened once more into angry triumph.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span></p>

<p>"But I saw him making love to you!" he
summed up hastily, as an afterthought.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;you did," I assured him exultantly.</p>

<p>"And you met him for the first time&mdash;let me
see? What day was it?"</p>

<p>I ignored the sarcasm.</p>

<p>"Tuesday," I answered. "At four o'clock in
the afternoon."</p>

<p>"And not a soul in this town knows a thing
about him!"</p>

<p>"Except myself," I protested. "I know a great
deal about him."</p>

<p>"Then, do you happen to know&mdash;I heard it
from a fellow in Pittsburgh who has followed his
meteoric career as captain of industry&mdash;do <i>you</i>
happen to know that he makes no secret of having
left England because he was so handicapped by
disadvantages of birth?"</p>

<p>I hesitated just a moment&mdash;not in doubt as to
what I should say, but as to how I should say it.</p>

<p>"That's all right, Guilford," I answered complacently.
"If his ancestors all looked like 'gentlemen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
of the jury' it doesn't lessen his own dignity
and grandeur."</p>

<p>Now, if you've never been in a circuit court
room you can't appreciate the above simile, but
Guilford was a lawyer.</p>

<p>He looked at me in a dazed fashion for an instant.</p>

<p>"Grace, you don't feel ill&mdash;nor anything&mdash;do
you?" he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!"</p>

<p>"But I can't believe that you're exactly right in
your mind!"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;maybe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can't believe that to-morrow morning will
actually dawn and find us asunder," he kept on
quickly. "It must be some sort of fantastic
dream."</p>

<p>"It will seem very&mdash;queer, at first, Guilford,"
I confessed, with a preliminary shrinking at the
thought of facing mother.</p>

<p>"Queer's no word to use in connection with it,"
he answered crossly, then I heard heavy footsteps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
in the corridor above, and I took a quick step toward
him.</p>

<p>"I must go up-stairs," I whispered. "Old man
Hudson is making night hideous, I know!&mdash;But
all this is really true, Guilford! And&mdash;and you
must wear <i>this</i> in your vest pocket now!"</p>

<p>I slipped the scarab ring into his hand.</p>

<p>"You are determined?" he asked dully.</p>

<p>"I am&mdash;awakened," I replied.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that you are not really in love with me&mdash;never
have been in love with me, and never
could be except upon certain occasions when I
was dreadfully dressed-up&mdash;where there were red
roses and the sound of violin music."</p>

<p>"Grace, you are&mdash;unkind," he said, with a groping
look on his face. "I confess that I don't in
the least understand you!"</p>

<p>"Then how lucky we are!" I exclaimed. "So
many people don't find this out until after they've
got their house all furnished! We're going to be
friends always, Guilford."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span></p>

<p>Then, without waiting for him to say more I
turned away and ran breathlessly up the steps into
the office.</p>

<p>The brilliant light in the city news room met
me squarely as I opened the door. I blinked a
little&mdash;then raised my left hand and examined it
closely. It looked&mdash;<i>awful</i>! I had worn that same
ring ever since I was seventeen years old&mdash;and I
felt as I might feel if I'd just had my hair cut off
or suffered some other unprecedented loss.</p>

<p>The city editor looked up from his desk.</p>

<p>"Well?" he inquired. "Have you got it?"</p>

<p>I was still gazing at that left hand.</p>

<p>"No," I answered stupidly. "It's <i>gone</i>!"</p>

<p>He jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>"Here!" he commanded sharply. "Sit down
here!"</p>

<p>I sat down, letting my bag slide to the floor.</p>

<p>"You don't feel sick&mdash;do you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You didn't fall off the street-car&mdash;did you?"</p>

<p>"No."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span></p>

<p>"You haven't happened to any sort of trouble&mdash;have
you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>The "No&mdash;No&mdash;No&mdash;" was in the monotonous
tone a person says "Ninety-nine" when his lungs
are being examined.</p>

<p>Mr. Hudson looked at me closely.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;the story!" he said.</p>

<p>I blankly reached for my bag, opened it and
took out the blank copy paper.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;damn&mdash;" he began, then swallowed.</p>

<p>This awakened me from my trance.</p>

<p>"But he <i>does</i>!" I exclaimed in triumph. He <i>is</i>&mdash;and
he's <i>going to be</i>!"</p>

<p>"Here?" the editorial voice called out sharply
and joyously. "Here in Oldburgh?"</p>

<p>My head bobbed a concise yes.</p>

<p>"Bigger and better than ever?" my questioner
tormented.</p>

<p>"A thousand times! Happiness for everybody!&mdash;Where
there's a family there'll also be a House
that's a Home&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span></p>

<p>The old fellow began scribbling.</p>

<p>"I reckon he means model cottages," he observed
sourly. "They all make a great pretense
of loving their neighbor as themselves in this day
and time."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;even if it's a cottage it will certainly be
a model one&mdash;and what more could one desire?"
I asked, rambling again.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;what else?"</p>

<p>"And&mdash;oh! Gardens! Gardens&mdash;gardens!"</p>

<p>He held up his hand.</p>

<p>"Wait&mdash;you go too darn fast!"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry! Maybe I have gone too fast!" I
answered, as I settled back in my chair and my
face reddened uncomfortably. "Maybe I have
gone too fast!"</p>

<p>"You have! You confuse me&mdash;talking the way
you do and looking the way you do! By rights
I ought to make you write the story out yourself&mdash;but
you don't look as if you could spell 'Unprecedented
good fortune in the annals of Oldburgh's
industrial career,' to-night!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm sure I couldn't," I admitted readily.
"Please don't ask me to."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;go on with your narrative. What
else?"</p>

<p>"Acres and acres! Acres and <i>acres</i>!" I impressed
upon him. "That's what I've always
wanted! I love acres so much better than neighbors&mdash;don't
you?"</p>

<p>He paused in his writing.</p>

<p>"Of course the Macdermott Realty Company
did the stunt?" he asked, scratching his head with
his pencil tip and leaving a little black mark along
the field of redness. "We mustn't forget to mention
each individual member of the firm.&mdash;And
then&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"A schoolhouse," I remembered.</p>

<p>He glared.</p>

<p>"A schoolhouse?" he questioned. "What for?"</p>

<p>"For the children!" I answered, lowering my
eyes. "Did you think there wouldn't be any children?
How could there be a House that was a
Home without them?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, and this fellow, Tait, is going to see to it
that they're educated, eh? They're going to have
advantages that he didn't have&mdash;and all that sort
of thing? Very praiseworthy, I'm sure!"</p>

<p>I sprang up from my chair.</p>

<p>"I'm going home, Mr. Hudson, please!" I
begged. "There <i>is</i> something wrong with my
head."</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"It's different from any other woman's head
I ever saw," he admitted half grudgingly. "It's
<i>level</i>!"</p>

<p>"But indeed you're mistaken!" I plead. "Right
this minute I'm&mdash;I'm seeing things!"</p>

<p>Then, when I said this a gentle light stole over
his face&mdash;such a light I'm sure that few people
ever saw there&mdash;perhaps nobody ever had except
Mrs. Hudson the day he proposed to her.</p>

<p>"Visions?" he asked kindly. "A House that's
a Home&mdash;and <i>English</i> gardens."</p>

<p>"That's not fair!" I warned. "I really ought
not to have gone out there to-night&mdash;and I don't
know whether he'll want all this written up or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
not&mdash;for I didn't mention the <i>Herald's</i> name in
our conversation, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bosh!" he snapped. "Rot! And piffle! You
had a right to go out there if I sent you&mdash;and of
course he can't object to the public knowing
<i>now</i>! Why, I expect any one of the reporters
could have got as much out of him to-night as
you did!"</p>

<p>"Do you really think so?" I asked, from the
doorway. "Good night, Mr. Hudson. You can
easily make two columns out of that, by drawing
on your&mdash;past experience."</p>

<p>He waved me crossly away, without once looking
up or saying "Thank you" and I caught a
car home. Half an hour later, when the curve
was turned into the full face of West Clydemont
Place I still thought I was "seeing things." A big
motor-car stood before our door, but my heart
changed its tune when I got closer. It was not a
limousine. It was a doctor's coupé. Mother had
suffered a violent chill.</p>

<p>"Grace, I&mdash;have no words!" she moaned, as I
came into the room.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<span class="s08">THE SKIES FALL</span></h2>

<p>Before morning words began coming to
her&mdash;gradually. First she moaned, then
muttered, then raged. The chill disappeared and
fever came on. By daybreak, however, they had
both been left with the things that were, and
mother slipped into her kimono.</p>

<p>"Go bring me the morning paper," she condescended,
after the passing of the creamery
wagon announced that busy life was still going
on.</p>

<p>I rushed out into the front yard. The tree-tops
were misty with that white fog which looks as if
darkness were trailing her nightrobe behind her;
and already on the neighboring lawns the automatic
sprinklers were caroming across the green
as if they had St. Vitus' dance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span></p>

<p>"On a day like this <i>nothing</i> is too good to be
true!" I decided, as I picked up the paper and
scurried back into the house.</p>

<p>"And got <i>your</i> name to it&mdash;Grace Chalmers
Christie!" mother wailed in despair, as she opened
the sheet and saw two columns, broken by a face
that could do much more sensible things than
"launch a thousand ships and burn the topless
towers of Ilium."</p>

<p>"Let's&mdash;see," I suggested, peering over her
shoulder and watching the words dancing up and
down on either side of this face. I couldn't read
anything, but I managed to catch an occasional
"Macdermott" as it pranced along in front of an
occasional "model cottage."</p>

<p>"Take it!&mdash;Burn it!" mother commanded, after
she had read enough to realize that the thing was
entirely too dull to prove interesting to any
feminine creature.</p>

<p>She thrust it into my hand, and I took it into
my bedroom, where I began a frenzied search for
the scissors.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span></p>

<p>"I'd rather have you by yourself&mdash;away from
all suggestions of Macdermotts and enlarged traction
companies," I whispered, snipping the picture
from the page and laying it caressingly in the
drawer of the old-fashioned desk.</p>

<p>There it lay all morning&mdash;and I whispered to it
and caressed it.</p>

<p>"A picture in a drawer is worth two on the
wall," I said once, as I pushed it away quickly to
keep mother from seeing it. But the fun of the
secret was not at all times uppermost.</p>

<p>"You are so beautiful&mdash;so beautiful," I wailed,
as I looked at it another time. "I almost wish
you were not&mdash;so beautiful."</p>

<p>For you must know that no woman in love ever
<i>enjoys</i> her man's good looks! She loves him for
so many other things besides beauty that she feels
this demand is a needless cruelty&mdash;adding to her
torture and making her love him the more. The
only male beauty she can ungrudgingly adore is
that which she cradles in her arms&mdash;the miniature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
of the Big Good Looks which have lured her and
tormented her!</p>

<p>Then&mdash;just for the sake of keeping away from
this drawer&mdash;I did different things to pass away
the morning. I said good-by to the picture, then
went into the library and looked up a word in the
dictionary. I looked at the picture again after
that&mdash;to make sure that it was still there&mdash;then I
decided to wash my hair. But I changed my
mind, for I was afraid the water might drip on
the picture and ruin it. I looked up a bodkin and
some blue baby ribbon&mdash;and forgot to gear up the
corset-cover whose eyelets were gaping hungrily
before my eyes. While I was trying to remember
what one usually does with a bodkin and blue ribbon
I looked at the picture again&mdash;and, well, if
you have ever been there you can understand;
and if you haven't no words could ever explain.</p>

<p>Then the telephone in the hall! I tried to keep
away from it as hard as they say a murderer tries
to keep away from the scene of his crime.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span></p>

<p>"I won't call him until afternoon," I kept telling
myself. "It would be perfectly outrageous.
I'll call him from the office&mdash;just about dusk,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then I began seeing things again&mdash;houses and
English gardens, with children and schoolhouses
in the background, and a smile on the face of Pope
Gregory, the Somethingth, when he saw the Union
Jack and Old Glory flying in peace above this
vision&mdash;until I came to the office in time for the
one o'clock staff meeting.</p>

<p>The first thing I saw there was a note lying on
my desk. It bore no post-mark, so I knew that it
must have come by messenger.</p>

<p>"What can he have said?" I thought, catching
it up and weighing it in my hands. "And I wonder
why he sent it here to the <i>Herald</i> office, instead
of out home&mdash;and why he addressed it to
Miss G. C. Christie, as if it were a business
communication instead of to Miss Grace Chalmers
Christie, and why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I looked at it again. It was surely from him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
for it was written on traction company paper. I
was glad of this, for I can forgive a man for anything&mdash;if
he doesn't use fancy note-paper with his
monogram in the corner.</p>

<p>I weighed it, and turned it over several times,
and found a vague "Habana" fragrance about it&mdash;before
I ran a hairpin under the flap and opened
it. It ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"My dear Miss Christie&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have no doubt that you already know every
man to be an Achilles&mdash;who welds a heel protector
out of his egotism. Now, it happens that my
most vulnerable spot is a distaste to being made a
fool of; and to-day I can realize what a heavy
coating of self-importance lay over this spot
yesterday to blind me to your real motive.</p>

<p>"My apology for being such an easy-mark is
that it was a case of mistaken identity. I want
you to know that, as an actress, you are amazing!
I firmly believed that an unusually fair and charming
woman was doing me a great honor&mdash;but I
awoke this morning from my trance to find that a
clever newspaper reporter had outwitted me.</p>

<p>"I understand now why American Woman
must be kept as a tormenting side-issue in a man's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
busy life. He can't afford to let her come to the
front or she throws dust in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Of course the words I said to the vision of
my own fancy and the promises I exacted, do not
hold good with the reporter. I am leaving Oldburgh
at noon to-day, and even if I were not, you
would not care to see me again, since I know nothing
more that would serve as a front-page article
for the <i>Herald</i>."</p>

<p><span class="left25">
"Very sincerely yours,</span><br />
<span class="left45">"<span class="smcap">Maitland Tait</span>."</span></p>
</div>

<p>Now, do you know what happens when a
woman receives such a letter as this&mdash;a letter that
starts seismic disturbances? Well, first she blames
her eyesight. She thinks she hasn't read the thing
aright! Then she carries it off into some dark
corner where she hopes she can see better, for the
strong glare of day seems to make matters worse.
If there's an attic near, so much the better!</p>

<p>But there was no available attic to the <i>Herald</i>
office, so I walked into the society editor's private
room and slammed the door. I had thrust the
note into my blouse, so that I'd have a little breathing-spell
while I was getting it out, and as I tugged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
with a contrary belt pin I breathed very hard
and fast.</p>

<p>But the second reading disclosed few details
that had not been sent over the wires at the first
report. Likewise the third, fourth and fifth.
After that I lost count, and when I regained consciousness
there was a heavy knock at the door&mdash;a
knock in the possessive case. I rose wearily
and admitted the rightful owner.</p>

<p>"Say, Grace," she commenced excitedly, "the
old man's asking for you&mdash;Captain Macauley!
He wants you to come down to his den at once
for an interview. How does it feel to be the biggest
thing on the <i>Herald</i>&mdash;for a day?"</p>

<p>I put my hand up to my forehead.</p>

<p>"It feels like&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>"Then try to look like it," she suggested.
"Why, you look positively seasick to-day."</p>

<p>I didn't stop to explain my bearing false witness,
but dashed past her to the head of the stairs.
Captain Macauley's office was on a lower floor,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
and by the time I had gone leisurely down the
steps I had quieted my eyelids somewhat.</p>

<p>"Well, Grace&mdash;how about the illegitimate use
of weapons?" the old man laughed, lifting his
shaggy head from the front page of the day's
<i>Herald</i>, as I entered. "Sit down! Sit down&mdash;I
want to talk with you."</p>

<p>But for a moment he failed to talk. He looked
me over quizzically, then turned to his desk and
drew a yellow envelope from a pigeonhole. It
was a telegram. I opened it wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Pauline Calhoun met with a serious motor-car
accident yesterday and will be compelled to
cancel her contract with you." I read. I looked
at the old man.</p>

<p>"To go abroad this summer for the <i>Herald</i>?"
I asked.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"We've <i>advertised</i> her going," he said mournfully.
"And the transportation is here."</p>

<p>"She was to have sailed Saturday week?" I
asked, wondering at the cunning machinery of my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
own brain, which could keep on working after it
was cold and dead! Every inch of my body was
paralyzed.</p>

<p>"On the <i>Luxuria</i>," he said cheeringly, as he
saw my expression. "The <i>Luxuria</i>, mind you,
young lady!"</p>

<p>"And to miss it? How tragic!" I kept on
absently, wishing that the whole Cunard Line was
at the bottom of the sea if he meant to keep me
there chattering about it all day.</p>

<p>"But it's tragic for the <i>Herald</i>," he snapped.
"Don't you see we're up against it? Here, every
paper in the South is doing stunts like this&mdash;getting
out special stuff with its individual brand&mdash;and
Pauline Calhoun can deliver the goods."</p>

<p>"Not with her arm broken," I mused aloud.</p>

<p>He looked at me impatiently.</p>

<p>"The thing is, we've got to send <i>somebody</i>
abroad next week&mdash;somebody whose leg is not
broken!"</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"And Hudson and I have been discussing you.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
This job you roped in last night was more than
we'd given you credit for, and&mdash;so&mdash;well, can't
you speak?"</p>

<p>I couldn't speak, but I could laugh. I felt as
if my fairy godmother had taken me to a moving-picture
show&mdash;where one scene was from Dante's
<i>Inferno</i> and the next one was from a novel by the
Duchess.</p>

<p>"There'd be Italy&mdash;&mdash;" Captain Macauley began,
but I shrank back.</p>

<p>"Not Italy!" I begged. "I couldn't go to Italy
now."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because you'd want me to write a lot of sentimental
stuff from there&mdash;and I'm not sentimental&mdash;now."</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"Italy is the land of lovers," he whispered, his
eyes twinkling over some 1870 recollection. "You
must be in love with <i>somebody</i> when you're in
Italy&mdash;and you can no more hide it than you can
hide nettle-rash."</p>

<p>"I don't want to go there," I said stiffly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_255.jpg" width="345" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">"Well, can't you speak?"</p>
</div>

<p>"Well, you wouldn't have to!" he answered
readily. "This steamer ticket reads from New
York to Liverpool."</p>

<p>"Liverpool?" I repeated, as blankly as if
geography hadn't been my favorite book at school&mdash;to
eat apples behind.</p>

<p>"And Hudson suggested, since you showed last
night that you were keen on getting the news of
the hour, that you'd likely succeed in a new line
in England. We've been surfeited on Westminster
Abbey and the lakes, so we want <i>news</i>!
Coal strikes and suffragettes&mdash;and other curses!"</p>

<p>"News?"</p>

<p>"Instead of mooning around Hampstead Heath
listening to the newest scandal about George
Romney and his lady friend, stay strictly in the
twentieth century and get in line with the militants.
Describe how they address crowds from
cart-tails."</p>

<p>"I see," I said slowly.</p>

<p>But in my attempts to see I think I must have
passed my left hand across my forehead. At all
events, he caught sight of its ringless state.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span></p>

<p>"Grace!" he exclaimed, catching my fingers
roughly and scrutinizing the little pallid circle left
by the ring's long contact&mdash;sometimes the healthiest,
sometimes the deadliest pallor that female
flesh is heir to! "Does this mean that you've
broken off with Guilford Blake?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>His face grew grave.</p>

<p>"Then, child, I beg your pardon for talking so
glibly about your going away!&mdash;I didn't know."</p>

<p>"But it isn't that&mdash;it's not that I'm worrying
over now," I explained forlornly. "And Guilford's
not hurt! Please don't waste sympathy
on him. He'll be glad, when the first shock gets
over, for I've tormented him unmercifully."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;what is it?" he asked, very gently.</p>

<p>I drew away my hand.</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;something <i>else</i>! And please don't
change your mind about sending me abroad! I'd
like very much to go away from here. Anywhere
except to Italy."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span></p>

<p>He reached over and patted my bereft hand
affectionately.</p>

<p>"So the something else is the same sort of
something, after all?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>"Then run along and begin getting ready," he
said. "Get clothes in your head&mdash;and salt-sprayed
decks on moonlight nights, and wild adventures."</p>

<p>I smiled.</p>

<p>"That's right! Smile! I <i>can't</i> send out a
representative with a broken leg&mdash;and I'd prefer
not sending out one with a broken heart."</p>

<p>I turned away then, struggling fiercely with
something in my throat, but just for an instant.</p>

<p>"Broken heart!" I repeated scornfully. "It's
not that bad. You mustn't think I'm such a
fool."</p>

<p>"Well," he said briskly, "whatever it is, cut it
out! And, believe me, my dear, a steamer trunk
is the best possible grave for unrequited love."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

<span class="s08">THE JOURNEY</span></h2>

<p>Personally, I am of such an impatient
disposition that I can't bear to read a chapter
in a book which begins: "Meanwhile&mdash;&mdash;"
Life is too short for meanwhiles! But, since the
Oldburgh epoch of my career has passed, and the
brilliant new epoch has a sea-voyage before it&mdash;and
crossing the ocean is distinctly a "meanwhile"
occupation&mdash;I have decided to mark time
by taking extracts from my green leather voyage
book, with the solid gold clasp and the pencil that
won't write. (The city editor gave me the book.)</p>

<p>The first entry was made at the breakfast table
in an unnecessarily smart New York hotel.
That's one bad feature about having a newspaper
pay your traveling expenses! You can't have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
the pleasure of indulging the vagabondage of your
nature&mdash;as you can when you're traveling on
your hook. The lonely little entry says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"<i>Hate</i> New York! Always feel countrified
and unpopular here!"</p>
</div>

<p>But the next one was much better. It reads:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"<i>Love</i> the sea, whose principal charm is the
sky above it! The one acceptable fact about
orthodox Heaven is that it's up in the sky. You
couldn't endure it if it were in any closer
quarters."</p>
</div>

<p>Yet between New York and Heaven there lay
several unappreciated days&mdash;days when I sat for
long hours facing strange faces and hearing a
jumbled jargon about "barth" hours, deck chairs
and miscarried roses. By the way, a strange
trick of fate had filled my own bare little stateroom
with flowers. I say a trick of fate, because
some of them were for Pauline Calhoun, whose
New York friends had heard of her proposed
journey, but not of her accident, and some of
them were addressed to me. I could understand
the Pauline blossoms, but those directed to Miss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
Grace Christie were mystifying&mdash;very. But I
accepted them with hearty thanks, and the time I
spent wondering over them kept me from grieving
over the fact that the Statue of Liberty was
the only person on the horizon whose face I had
ever seen before; and they kept me feeling like a
prima donna for half a week.</p>

<p>"Henry Walker couldn't have sent them," I
pondered the first day, as the big, big box was
deposited inside my door. "He's not such a close
friend, even though he is the Hiram Walkers' son&mdash;and
then, New York law students never have
any money left over for orchids."</p>

<p>I enumerated all the other people I happened to
know in New York at that time, all of them there
for the purpose of "studying" something, and not
for the purpose of buying vast quantities of the
highest-priced flower blown, and the mystery only
loomed larger.</p>

<p>Still, the question could not keep me entirely
occupied between meals, and on the very day we
sailed, before we had got into the space where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
the union of the sea and sky seem to shut out all
pettiness, I got to feeling very sorry for myself.
Thinking to get rid of this by mingling with
humanity, I went down into the lounge, where
I was amazed to find dozens of other women
sitting around feeling sorry for themselves. It
was not an inspiring sight, so after a vain attempt
to read, I curled my arms round a sofa cushion in
the corner of the big room and turned my face
away from the world in general. The next communication
I received was rather unexpected. I
heard a brisk voice, close beside me exclaim:</p>

<p>"My word! A great big girl like you crying!"</p>

<p>It was an English voice&mdash;a woman's, or rather
a girl's, and as I braced up indignantly I met the
blue-gray eyes of a fresh-faced young Amazon
bent toward my corner sympathetically.</p>

<p>"I'm not crying," I denied.</p>

<p>She turned directly toward me then, and I saw
a surprised smile come over her face.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>you</i>! No&mdash;I supposed that you were ill;
but the little kid over there&mdash;&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span></p>

<p>I saw then that there was a tiny girl tucked
farther away into the corner, her shoulders heaving
between the conflict of pride and grief.</p>

<p>"Cheer up, and I'll tell you a story," the English
girl encouraged, and after a few minutes the
small flushed face came out of its hiding-place.</p>

<p>"So you thought I was talking to <i>you</i>?"</p>

<p>She turned to me laughingly after the smaller
bunch of loneliness had been soothed and sent
away.</p>

<p>"I was&mdash;mistaken&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I'm sure I should have offered to tell you
a story&mdash;if I had supposed that it would do you
any good," she continued.</p>

<p>"Almost anything&mdash;any sound of a human
voice would do me good now," I answered
desperately, and with that sky-rocket sort of spontaneity
which you feel you can afford once or
twice in a lifetime.</p>

<p>"You're alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and miserable."</p>

<p>Her blue eyes were very frank and friendly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
and I immediately straightened up with a hope
that we might discover some mutual interest
nearer and dearer than the Boston Tea-Party.</p>

<p>That's one good thing about a seafaring life&mdash;the
preliminaries that you are able to do without
in making friends. If you meet a nice woman
who discovers that her son went to Princeton
with your father's friend's nephew you at once
take it for granted that you may tell her many
things about yourself that are not noted down in
your passport.</p>

<p>"You're American&mdash;of course?" this English
girl asked next.</p>

<p>I acquiesced patriotically, but not arrogantly.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I'm American! My name's Grace
Christie, and I'm a newspaper woman from&mdash;from&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I hesitated, and she looked at me inquiringly.</p>

<p>"I didn't understand the name of the state?"
she said.</p>

<p>"Because I haven't told you yet!" I laughed.
"I remember other experiences in mentioning my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
native place to you English. You always say,
'Oh, the place where the negro minstrels come
from!'"</p>

<p>She smiled, and her face brightened suddenly.</p>

<p>"The South! How nice! I <i>love</i> Americans!"
she exclaimed, confiding the clause about her
affection for my countrymen in a lowered voice,
and looking around to make sure that no one
heard.</p>

<p>Then, after this, it took her about half a minute
to invite me out of my corner and to propose that
I go and meet her father and mother.</p>

<p>"We'll find them in the library," she ventured,
and we did.</p>

<p>"The South! How nice! We <i>love</i> Americans!"
they both exclaimed, as we unearthed them a little
while later in a corner of the reading-room. And
before they had confided to me their affection for
my countrymen they lowered their voices and
glanced at their daughter to make sure that she
was not listening. They made their observations
in precisely the same tone and they looked precisely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
alike, except that the father had side-whiskers.
They were both small and slight and
very durably dressed.</p>

<p>"Miss Christie is a newspaper woman&mdash;traveling
alone!"</p>

<p>The daughter, whom they addressed as "Hilda"
made the announcement promptly, and her manner
seemed to warn them that if they found this
any just cause or impediment they were to speak
now or else hereafter forever hold their peace.</p>

<p>"Indeed?" said the mother, looking over my
clothes with a questioning air, which, however,
did not disapprove. "Indeed?"</p>

<p>"My word!" said the father, also taking stock
of me, but his glance got no further than my
homesick face. "My <i>word</i>!"</p>

<p>But you are not to suppose from the tone that
anything had gone seriously wrong with his word.
He said it in a gently searching way, as an old
grandfather, seeking about blindly on the mantlepiece
might say, "My spectacles!"</p>

<p>So realistic was the impression of his peering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
around mildly in search of something that I almost
jumped up from my chair to see if I could,
by mistake, be sitting on his word.</p>

<p>"Isn't she young?"</p>

<p>His twinkling little gray eyes sought his wife's
as if for corroboration, and she nodded vigorously.</p>

<p>"Indeed, yes, Herbert! But they shed their
pinafores long before our girls do, remember!"</p>

<p>Then he turned to his daughter.</p>

<p>"My dear, the American women <i>are</i> so capable!"
he said, and she threw him a smile which
would have been regarded as impertinent&mdash;on
English soil.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sure I've no objections to being an
American woman myself," she said.</p>

<p>"And you do not mind the loneliness of the
trip you're taking?" the mother put in hastily, as
if to cover her daughter's remark.</p>

<p>"I didn't&mdash;until to-day."</p>

<p>"But we must see to it now that you're not too
lonely," she hastened to assure me. "Where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
have they put you in the dining-room, my dear?"</p>

<p>I mentioned my table's location.</p>

<p>"Oh, but we'll get the steward to change you at
once!" they chorused, when it had been pointed
out to them that my position in the salon was
isolated and far away from the music of the
orchestra.</p>

<p>"We're just next the captain's table," Hilda
explained. "We happened to know him and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And it's inspiring to watch the liberties he
takes with the menu," the father said. "I'd best
write down our number, though I'll see the
steward myself."</p>

<p>From his pocketbook he produced a card,
scribbling their table number upon the back and
handing it to me.</p>

<p>I took it and glanced at the legend the face of
it bore, first of all, for figures are just figures,
even though they do radiate out from the captain's
table.</p>

<p>"Mr. Herbert Montgomery, Bannerley Hall,
Bannerley, Lancashire," was the way it read.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span></p>

<p>"Lancashire?" I asked, looking up so quickly
that Hilda mistook my emotion for dismay.</p>

<p>"Yes, we live in Lancashire, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But we're going on to London first," Mrs.
Montgomery assured me.</p>

<p>"We'll see to it that you're put down, safe and
sound, at Charing Cross," Mr. Herbert Montgomery
finished up.</p>

<p>I looked up again, this time in sheer bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Liverpool's in Lancashire," Hilda explained.
"I thought perhaps you were afraid we would
desert you as soon as we docked."</p>

<p>I laughed in some embarrassment.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I never before heard that Liverpool
had any connection with Lancashire," I explained.
"But I was thinking of&mdash;something else."</p>

<p>"Something else&mdash;how curious! Why, what
else is Lancashire noted for in America, pray?"</p>

<p>They were all three looking at me in some excitement,
for my eyes were betraying the palpitations
I was experiencing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you&mdash;does it happen that you have ever
heard of Colmere Abbey?" I asked.</p>

<p>They drew a deep breath, evidently relieved.</p>

<p>"Do we!" they chorused again, as they had a
habit of doing, I learned, whenever they were surprised
or amused. "Well, <i>rather</i>!"</p>

<p>"Surely you don't mean to tell me that it's your
own home?" I demanded, wondering if coincidence
had gone so far, but they shook their
heads.</p>

<p>"No! Just next-door neighbors."</p>

<p>"Next-door neighbors to the place, my dear
young lady," Mr. Montgomery modified, glancing
at his wife rather reproachfully. "Not to
the&mdash;owner of Colmere!"</p>

<p>But I scarcely heard him. I was trying to
place an ancient memory in my mind.</p>

<p>"'Bannerley Hall!'"</p>

<p>"That's our place."</p>

<p>"But I'm trying to remember where I have
heard of it," I explained. "Of course! They
all mentioned it at one time or another."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span></p>

<p>"They?&mdash;Who, my dear? Why Herbert&mdash;isn't
this interesting?"</p>

<p>"Why, Washington Irving&mdash;and Lady Frances
Webb&mdash;and Uncle James Christie."</p>

<p>Their questions and my half-dazed answers
were tumbling over one another.</p>

<p>"James Christie&mdash;Grace Christie?" Mrs. Montgomery
asked, connecting our names with a delighted
opening of her eyes. "Why, my <i>dear</i>!"</p>

<p>"How fortunate I was!" observed Hilda. "I
knew, though, from the moment I saw the back
of your head that you were no ordinary American
tourist!"</p>

<p>"They all 'rode over to Bannerley Hall&mdash;the
day being fine!'" I quoted, from one of the letters
written by Lady Frances Webb.</p>

<p>"That was in my great-grandfather's time,"
Mr. Montgomery elucidated. "And James
Christie was your&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Uncle&mdash;with several 'greats' between."</p>

<p>"He was even more famous in England than
in his own country," Mrs. Montgomery threw in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
hastily, as she saw her husband's eyes twinkling&mdash;a
sure sign, I afterward learned, that he was
going to say something wicked. "He painted all
the notable people of the age."</p>

<p>"He made many pictures of the Lady Frances
Webb," Mr. Montgomery succeeded in saying,
after a while. "I don't know whether it's well
known in America or not, but&mdash;there was&mdash;<i>talk</i>!"</p>

<p>"Herbert!"</p>

<p>He stiffened.</p>

<p>"It's true, my dear."</p>

<p>"We don't know whether it's true or not!" she
contended.</p>

<p>"Well, it's tradition! I'm sure Miss Christie
wouldn't want to come to England and not learn
all the old legends she might."</p>

<p>Then, partly because I was bubbling over with
excitement, and partly because I wished to ease
Mrs. Montgomery's mind on the subject, I began
telling them my story&mdash;from the day of Aunt
Patricia's sudden whim, three days before her
death, down to the packet of faded letters lying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
at that moment in the bottom of my steamer
trunk.</p>

<p>"I thought perhaps the present owner of Colmere
might let me burn them there!" I explained.
"I have pictured her as a dear and somewhat
lonely old dowager who would take a great deal
of interest in this ancient affair."</p>

<p>The three looked at me intently for an instant,
but not one of them laughed.</p>

<p>"And you're carrying them back to Colmere&mdash;instead
of selling them!" Mrs. Montgomery
finally uttered in a little awed voice, as I finished
my story. "How extraordinary!"</p>

<p>"Very," said Hilda.</p>

<p>"Most un-American&mdash;if you'll not be offended
with me for saying so, Miss Christie," Mr. Montgomery
observed. Then he turned to his wife.
"My dear, only <i>think</i> of Lord Erskine!" he said.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"But I mustn't!" she answered, with a sad little
smile. "I really couldn't think of Lord Erskine
while listening to anything so pretty."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span></p>

<p>I caught at the name, curiously.</p>

<p>"Lord Erskine?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;the present owner of the abbey."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;what a beautiful-sounding name! Lord
Erskine!"</p>

<p>I looked at them encouragingly, but a hush
seemed to have fallen over their audible enthusiasm.
Mrs. Montgomery's lips presently primped
themselves up into a signal for me to come closer
to her side&mdash;where her husband might not hear
her.</p>

<p>"Lord Erskine is, my dear&mdash;the most&mdash;notorious
old man in <i>England</i>!" she pronounced&mdash;so
terribly that "And may the Lord have mercy on
his soul" naturally followed. Her verdict was
final.</p>

<p>"But what has he done?" I started to inquire,
the journalistic tendency for the moment uppermost,
but her lips showed white lines of repression.</p>

<p>"He is never <i>mentioned</i>!" she warned briefly,
and I felt constrained to wish that the same punishment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
could be applied to America's ancient
sinners.</p>

<p>"Oh, so bad as that?"</p>

<p>She leaned closer.</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Christie, it would be impossible&mdash;quite
impossible&mdash;to enumerate the peccadillos
of that wretched old creature!"</p>

<p>"Yet you women are always ready to attempt
the impossible!" her husband interposed, after his
noisy attempt at lighting a cigarette had failed to
drown out our voices.</p>

<p>She looked up at him.</p>

<p>"Herbert, I don't understand you, I'm sure."</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't understand you, either!" he replied.
"For twenty years now I have noticed
that when two or three women in our part of the
country are gathered together the first thing they
say to each other before the men have come into
the room is that Lord Erskine's recent escapades
are positively unmentionable&mdash;then they fly at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
each other's throats for the privilege of retailing
them."</p>

<p>She continued to stare at him, steadily and with
no especial unfriendliness in her gaze.</p>

<p>"And the men&mdash;over their wine?" she asked
casually.</p>

<p>He squared his shoulders.</p>

<p>"That's a very different matter," he declared.
"With us he is as honest and open a diversion as
hunting! The first thing we say in greeting, if
we meet a neighbor on the road is: 'What's the
latest news from Lord Erskine?'"</p>

<p>Their eyes challenged each other humorously
for another moment, when Hilda broke in.</p>

<p>"Don't you think we've given Miss Christie a
fairly good idea that she mustn't expect to be invited
down to Colmere Abbey&mdash;and that if she is
invited, she mustn't go?" she inquired, with
gentle sarcasm.</p>

<p>"But, before we get away from the subject&mdash;what
of the Webb family?" I begged forlornly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
"Is there no one living who might take an interest
in the story of Lady Frances?"</p>

<p>I am sure my voice was as sad with disappointment
as old Joe Jefferson's used to be when he'd
plead: "Does <i>no one</i> know Rip Van Winkle?"</p>

<p>"Lord Erskine's mother was a Webb," Mrs.
Montgomery explained.</p>

<p>"The one fact which can be stated about the
old gentleman which need not be blushed for,"
her husband added. "In truth, he has always
been vastly proud of his lineage."</p>

<p>"About all that he's ever had to be proud of!
His own performances in social and family life
have been&mdash;well, what I have outlined to you. I
happened to know details of some earlier happenings,
and all I can say is that my own attitude
toward Lord Erskine is rather unchristian."</p>

<p>"But I believe Miss Christie was asking about
the family history further back than the present
lord," Hilda reminded them again, and her
mother took the cue.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes! To be sure! It's the failing of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
later years, my dear, to wish to discuss one's own
memories! But of course your interest lies in
the traditions of the novelist."</p>

<p>"Her history has always held a peculiar interest
for me," I replied, "first, naturally, on account
of the connecting link&mdash;then on account of the&mdash;tragic
complication&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She nodded her head briskly.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;poor Lady Frances! She was not very
happy, if the ancient reports be true."</p>

<p>"I judge not&mdash;from her letters."</p>

<p>"But her memory is held in great reverence by
the educated people around in the country," she
hastened to assure me. "And there is a lovely
memorial tablet in the church&mdash;quite aside from
the tomb! A literary club of London had it
placed there!"</p>

<p>"And every birthday there are wreaths," Mr.
Montgomery threw in, evidently hoping to make
it up to me for the disheartening gossip of the
present age; but my dreams were rapidly fading&mdash;and
I saw my chances for having a bonfire on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
the library hearth at Colmere go up in something
far more unsubstantial than smoke.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sure we've told Miss Christie quite
enough about our neighbors&mdash;for a first sitting,"
Hilda Montgomery broke in at this point, as she
rose and made a reckless suggestion that we go
out and walk a little while. "<i>I</i> don't wish to
spend the whole afternoon talking about a villainous
old Englishman!" she confided, when we were
well out of ear-shot. "One might spend the time
talking about 'Americans&mdash;don't you know?'"</p>

<p>"Americans?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;charming, handsome, young Americans!
You remember the first thing I told you was that
I loved Americans?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and your father and mother said they
did, too&mdash;when you weren't listening."</p>

<p>She nodded her blond head, in energetic delight.</p>

<p>"They are trying to pretend that it will be a
difficult matter to win their consent&mdash;but it
won't."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span></p>

<p>We steered our course around a group of people
who were disputing, in Wabash tones, over a
game of shuffleboard.</p>

<p>"Consent?" I repeated.</p>

<p>"His name is John McAdoo Carpenter&mdash;and
he lives at South Bend, Indiana&mdash;did you ever
hear of the place? Did you ever hear of him?"</p>

<p>She caught me by the arm and we walked precipitately
over to the railing&mdash;out of the sound of
the Wabash tones.</p>

<p>"If I don't talk to somebody before that sun
goes down I'll jump right over this railing," she
explained. "Here's his picture!"</p>

<p>I took the small blue leather case and looked at
the honest, rather distinguished face it held.</p>

<p>"But why should your parents disapprove of
<i>him</i>?" I asked in such genuine surprise that she
gave me a smile which sealed forever our friendship.</p>

<p>"They don't&mdash;really! It's just that they like
to torment me because he happened not to be born
in either New York or Kentucky. An Englishman's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
knowledge of America's excellence extends
no further than that."</p>

<p>Night was coming on&mdash;and the sea looked
pretty vast and unfriendly. It was the lonesome
hour, when any feminine thing far away from
home has to wax either confidential or tearful.
Hilda was determined to be confidential, and I
let her have her say. I went down, after a while,
and dressed for dinner&mdash;listlessly and without
heart, but when I went into the dining-room a
little later and found my place at the table next
the captain's, the geniality of the family atmosphere
I found there was vastly cheering.</p>

<p>Mrs. Montgomery was a rather magnificent
little gray-haired lady in gray satin and diamonds,
and her husband had made the evolution from the
chrysalis state into that of the butterfly by donning
his dress clothes and putting up a monocle
in place of the comfortable reading glasses he had
worn in the afternoon. Hilda was wholesome
and sweet-looking but quite secondary to her parents,
in a soft blue gown.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span></p>

<p>The subject under discussion when I arrived
was evidently the points of superiority of one
American locality over another and they took me
into their confidence at once.</p>

<p>"I appeal to you, Miss Christie, as an American,"
Mr. Montgomery said, after the steward
who had acted as my pilot was out of hearing.
"Shouldn't you think now&mdash;if you didn't know
the difference&mdash;<i>shouldn't</i> you think now that a
'South <i>Bender'</i> was a species of acrobat?"</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>Then, try as hard as I might to keep all physical
signs of my mental infirmity from cropping
out in my log-book, the second evening out found
an entry like this showing itself&mdash;written almost
entirely without effort on my part&mdash;like "spirit
writing":</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"To-night the orchestra is playing <i>The Rosary</i>,
and I had to get away from all those people in
the lounge!</p>

<p>"I have come down here&mdash;away from it, as I
thought, but, no! Those same high, wailing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
notes that we heard that first day&mdash;<i>that first day</i>&mdash;are
ringing in my ears this minute.</p>

<p>"How they sob&mdash;sob&mdash;sob! And over the
hours they spent together! That's the foolish
part of it! I am sobbing over the hours I <i>might</i>
have spent with him&mdash;and didn't!</p>

<p>"'Are like a string of pearls to me!'</p>

<p>"Bah! The hours I spent with him wouldn't
make pearls enough for a stick-pin&mdash;much less a
rosary!</p>

<p>"To me <i>Caro Mio Ben</i> is a much more sensible
little love plaint! I wonder if <i>he</i> knows it? I
wonder if he heard that girl singing in the parlor
the night of the Kendalls' dance&mdash;and if it still
rings&mdash;rings&mdash;rings in his mind every time he
thinks of me? Or if he ever thinks of me at
all?"
</p>
</div>

<p>I have inserted this not so much to show you
how very critical my case was, as to demonstrate
how valuable a thing is diversion. Without Hilda
and the elder Montgomerys I should no doubt
have tried to emulate Lady Frances Webb in the
feat of writing heart-throbs.</p>

<p>The third day's observation was a distinct improvement.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The men on shipboard are rather better than
the women&mdash;just as they are on dry land. True,
there are some who have sold Chicago real estate,
and are now bent upon spending the rest of their
lives running over to Europe to criticize everything
that they can not buy. Nothing is sacred
to them&mdash;until after they have paid duty on it.
They revere and caress their own Italian mantlepieces,
their cases of majolica, and their collection
of Wedgwood&mdash;when these are safely
decorating their lake-shore homes&mdash;but what Europe
keeps for herself they scorn.</p>

<p>"'Bah! I don't see anything so swell about
St. Mark's&mdash;nor St. Doge's either!' I heard one
emit this morning. 'But, old man, you just ought
to see the champagne glasses I bought last year in
Venice. The governor dined with me the other
night, and he said&mdash;&mdash;' etc.</p>

<p>"Then, there's another sort of Philistine, who
goes all over the Old World eating his lunch off
places where men have suffered, died, or invented
pendulums.</p>

<p>"'That confounded Leaning Tower <i>does</i> feel
like it's wiggling as you go up, but pshaw! it's
perfectly safe! Why, I stayed on top long
enough to eat three sandwiches and drink a bottle
of that red ink you get for half a dollar in
Florence!'</p>

<p>"This doesn't create much of a stir, however,
because there's always one better.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span></p>

<p>"'Nice little tower down there in Pisa&mdash;and
you really have to have something like that to
relieve your constitution of the pictorial strain in
Florence&mdash;but you see, after you've eaten hard-boiled
eggs on top of <i>Cheops</i>, climbing the Leaning
Tower is not half so exciting as riding a
sapling was when you were a boy!'</p>

<p>"'And oh, speaking of hard-boiled eggs&mdash;have
you ever been to Banff, Mr. Smith?' one of the
women in the crowd speaks up. 'Yes, the scenery
in the Canadian Rockies is all right, of course, but
just to <i>think</i> of having your eggs perfectly hot
and well done in the waters of Banff!'</p>

<p>"There are other women on board, however,
whose thoughts are not on food. They are more
amusing by far to watch than the innocent creatures
who love Banff. They manage to stay well
out of view by strong daylight, then come into
the lounge at night, dressed in plumes and diamonds
like Cinderella's stepsisters, and select the
husbands of sea-sick wives to ask advice about
focusing a kodak or going to Gibraltar to buy a
mandarin coat!</p>

<p>"But, as I have said, the men for the greater
part are much more interesting than the women&mdash;still
I have never aspired to a nautical flirtation,
for a month after one is past you can't recall the
principal's name. You do well if you can remember
his nationality."</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span></p>

<p>The entry broke off with this piece of sarcasm,
which, after all, is actual truth. A friend of
mine had such an experience. A month after a
bitter parting on a moonlit deck one night she
came face to face with the absent one in a church
in Rome&mdash;and all she could stammer was: "Oh&mdash;you
<i>Canadian</i>!"</p>

<p>The fourth day&mdash;after the last vestige of the
gulls had been left behind&mdash;I began to grow impatient.
The "meanwhile" aspect of life in general
was beginning to press down.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"I wish mother had named me 'Patience,' for
I love a joke!" I wrote frantically&mdash;with the
same feeling of suffocation which caused Lady
Frances Webb to rush out to the rose garden
where the sun-dial stood, to keep from hearing
the clock tick.</p>

<p>"To me, the inertia which a woman is supposed
to exhibit is the hardest part of her whole earthly
task! And I don't know what it's for, either,
unless to prepare her for a future incarnation into
a camel!</p>

<p>"Yet, if you're a woman, you just must stay
still and let your heart's desire slip through your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
fingers&mdash;even if you have to lock yourself up into
your bedroom closet to accomplish it!"</p>
</div>

<p>And yet, even as I wrote, I wondered what I'd
do when I should be back in America. Somehow,
I didn't exactly fancy myself getting a ticket
home from New York with stop-over privileges
at Pittsburgh&mdash;where I could spend an exciting
time looking up a city directory!</p>

<p>And so the remaining days of the voyage
passed. The Montgomery family planned to
have me go home with them, after a day in London,
and declared that I could find as much interesting
news to write home for the <i>Herald</i> from
Lancashire as from any other portion of the
United Kingdom, since one never knew where
a fire would be started or a bomb discovered
through the playful antics of the women who
have changed the "clinging" sex into the <i>flinging</i>
sex; and I had accepted fervently&mdash;when, on
the trip from Liverpool down to London, these
arrangements were abruptly upset.</p>

<p>We were a little late in landing, and rushed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
straight to the train, where a tea-basket, operated
in the compartment which we had to ourselves,
was giving me the assurance that surely, next to
a hayloft on a rainy morning, a private compartment
in a British train is the coziest spot on the
face of the earth, when Mr. Montgomery suddenly
dropped the sheet of newspaper he had been
eagerly scanning.</p>

<p>"My <i>word</i>!" he said.</p>

<p>His exclamation was so insistent that I immediately
felt in my pocket to see if I had his
word, and his wife glanced up from the lamp
which she was handling lovingly.</p>

<p>"Yes, Herbert?"</p>

<p>"But I say&mdash;Lord Erskine is dead!"</p>

<p>"Herbert!"</p>

<p>Her tone was accusing, but her husband
nodded, with a pleased look of assurance.</p>

<p>"You may read it for yourself, I'm sure&mdash;if
you don't believe me!"</p>

<p>He handed the paper over to her, and she received
it gingerly, after looking to the tea-basket
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
with a housewifely air, and placing the lamp quite
to one side, out of harm's way. Then she turned
to the article indicated, reading slowly, while her
daughter looked over her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Why, he's <i>been</i> dead!"</p>

<p>She glanced up suddenly, toward me, with a
shamefaced look.</p>

<p>"He was dead at the very time you were telling
Grace all those atrocious things about him!"
Hilda reminded her, smiling at the look of discomfiture
which had crept over the kindly,
wrinkled little face.</p>

<p>"Yes! It's&mdash;extraordinary!"</p>

<p>"And it makes us both feel&mdash;a little uncomfortable,
eh?"</p>

<p>Her husband's tone was tormenting, but she
turned on him seriously.</p>

<p>"I'm sure, Herbert, dear, you said quite as
much as I did!" she declared, evidently finding
relief in the knowledge. "Still&mdash;this news does
rather make one&mdash;think."</p>

<p>The girl rattled the sheet of paper excitedly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm thinking!" she announced, her eyes wide.
"I'm thinking of Colmere Abbey! What a chance
for some rich decent American! Somebody that
one could easily endure, you understand!"</p>

<p>"Hilda!"</p>

<p>She waved aside the reprimand.</p>

<p>"Grace understands me&mdash;and what I think of
Americans," she answered quickly. "But,
mother, this <i>is</i> a problem! What Englishman
would buy the place&mdash;with its haunting tales&mdash;and
monstrous value? Nobody would be rich
enough except one of the millionaires who owns
a dozen homes already. And the next-of-kin will
inherit nothing along with the place to keep it
up!"</p>

<p>"Hilda! This is neither respectful nor neighborly,"
her mother remonstrated again, then she
turned to her husband. "Shall you write to the
new Lord Erskine from London, Herbert?"</p>

<p>Her tone was one of foregone conclusion, conventional
enough, but very kindly, and her husband
nodded obediently.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, to be sure, my dear," he chirruped in a
dutiful way. "I shall wire his lawyers immediately
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And ask for the pleasure of putting him up
while he's in the country?"</p>

<p>"Certainly! Certainly!"</p>

<p>"It will be unpleasant&mdash;this period of mourning
that we shall have to affect&mdash;for his sake,"
she went on, "but it is out of respect for the
neighborly proprieties, after all."</p>

<p>Mrs. Montgomery was looking at us all in turn,
in some little perplexity, when a sudden recollection
came to me of how difficult it is sometimes to
amalgamate guests&mdash;no matter how many rooms
there are to one's house.</p>

<p>"And I'll defer my visit until later?" I suggested.</p>

<p>She instantly smiled across at me.</p>

<p>"Just a few days&mdash;if you don't mind, dear,"
she said. "I had planned so many delightful
things for <i>your</i> stay&mdash;and I know that you
wouldn't enjoy the period of mourning."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span></p>

<p>"Not so much as you would if you had known
Lord Erskine!" her husband put in wickedly.
"And I'm determined to mourn only the briefest
time possible."</p>

<p>"Not an hour later than Saturday!" his wife
promised generously&mdash;and a few hours afterward
when they put me down at Charing Cross
and sent me whirling away to a lady-like hotel in
Bloomsbury, it was with spoken, written and
pantomime directions as to which trains, and
what-timed trains&mdash;and <i>how many</i> trains I was
to take toward the end of the week to get to
Bannerley.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile I knuckled down devotedly
to London&mdash;and sent my deductions home across
seas, in neatly typed packets, to <i>The Oldburgh
Herald</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<span class="s08">LONDON</span></h2>

<p>What can't be appreciated can always be
ridiculed&mdash;whether it's Old Masters, new
waltzes, or a wife's Easter bonnet&mdash;and this is the
reason we have always had such reams of journalistic
"fun" at the expense of the broad English
"a" and the narrow English view.</p>

<p>For my part, I consider that&mdash;next to the
French in New Orleans&mdash;the English in England
are the golden-ruliest people to be found in profane
history.</p>

<p>You'll find that they're "insular" only when
they're traveling off their dear island&mdash;and it's
homesickness, after all, which makes them so disagreeably
arrogant.</p>

<p>To be sure, the Frenchman in New Orleans
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
will, if you ask him for a word of direction toward
the Old Absinthe House, take you into his
private office, draw for you a diagram of the
whole city, advise you at length not to go unescorted
into the Market, then follow you to the
door with the final warning: "And it would be
well for you to observe a certain degree of caution,
my dear young lady, for our city is filled
with wickedness, and your eyes are&mdash;<i>pardon?</i>&mdash;most
charming!"</p>

<p>This is delightful, of course, and by far the
most romantic thing in the way of adventure
America has to offer, but rambling around London
presents a dearer and more home-like charm.</p>

<p>The Englishman who directs you to a church,
or a university square, stops to say nothing about
your eyes&mdash;much less would he mention the existence
of good and evil&mdash;but he points out to you
the tomb, or chained Bible, or famous man's pew
you are seeking, then glides modestly away before
you've had time to say: "It's awfully good
of you to take all this trouble for a stranger!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span></p>

<p>But the truth of the matter is that you don't
in the least feel yourself a stranger in London,
and you like your kindly Englishman so cordially
that you secretly resolve to put a muzzle on your
own particular cannon cracker the next Fourth of
July.</p>

<p>The shilling guide-books speak of London as
the "gray old grandmother of cities," meaning
thereby to call attention to her upstart progeny
across the seas, but to my mind the title of grandmother
is much more applicable on account of the
joyous surprises she has shut away in dark closets.</p>

<p>One of the main pleasures of a visit to any
grandmother is the gift of treasure which she is
likely to call forth mysteriously from some
tightly-closed cupboard and place in your hands
for your own exclusive possession&mdash;and certainly
this old dingy city outgrannies granny when it
comes to that.</p>

<p>In the dingiest little book-stall imaginable,
lighted by a candle and tended by a ragged-cuffed
gentleman with a passion for Keats, you may find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
the very edition of something that college professors
in your native town are offering half a year's
salary for! You buy it for five dollars&mdash;which
seems much more insignificant when spoken of
by the pound&mdash;then run out and hail the nearest
cab, offering the chauffeur an additional shilling
to get you out of the neighborhood in ten seconds!
Your heart is thumping in guilty fear that the
ragged-cuffed gentleman with the passion for
Keats may discover his mistake and run after you
to demand his treasure back!</p>

<p>You make a similar escape, a few hours later,
with a Wedgwood tea-caddy, whose delicate
color the pottery has never been able to duplicate&mdash;and
with Sheffield plate your suit-case runneth
over!</p>

<p>And your emotions while doing all this? Why,
you've never before known what "calm content"
could mean.</p>

<p>In the first place, you never feel countrified and
unpopular in London, as you do in New York.
Your clothes have a way of brightening up and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
looking noticeably smart as if they'd just enjoyed
a sojourn at the dry cleaner's&mdash;and everybody
you meet seems to care particularly for Americans.
You are at home there&mdash;not merely with
the at-home feeling which a good hotel and agreeable
society give&mdash;but there's a feeling of satisfaction
much deeper than this. Something in
you, which has always known and loved England,
is seeing familiar faces again&mdash;the something
which made you strain your eyes over <i>Mother
Goose</i> by firelight years ago, and thrill over
<i>Ivanhoe</i> and anything which held the name "Sherwood
Forest" on its printed page. It's something
congenial&mdash;or prenatal&mdash;who knows?</p>

<p>(Oh yes! I answer very readily "Present!"
when any one calls: "Anglomaniac!")</p>

<p>It was only natural that I should let my adoration
for Great Britain show through in the copy
I sent home to <i>The Oldburgh Herald</i>, and as if
to prove that honesty is the best policy, I received
a letter of praise from Captain Macauley.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span></p>

<p>"Anybody can run a foreign country down,"
he wrote, "but you've proved that you're original
by praising one! Stay there as long as you have
an English adjective left to go upon, then forget
your sorrows, chase away down to Italy and show
us what you can do with 'bellissimo.'"</p>

<p>But I didn't do this, for the letter overtook me
only after I had reached Bannerley, and was seeing
things which I could hope for no words, either
English or Italian, to describe.</p>

<p>I left London on Friday&mdash;which I ought to
have had better sense than to do, having been
properly brought up by a black mammy&mdash;hoping
to reach the home of my shipboard friends early
enough Saturday morning to hear the pigeons
coo under the eaves of Bannerley Hall. All my
life I had cherished an ambition to hear pigeons
coo under eaves of an ancestral place, and with
this thought uppermost in my heart, I packed my
suit-case and drove to Paddington Station. I
received my first damper at the ticket window.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span></p>

<p>"Bannerley?" the agent repeated, looking at
me with a shade of pity, as I mentioned my destination.
"Bannerley?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, Bannerley!" I insisted, with some
effort toward a dignified bearing, but the first
glance at his doubtful face caused my spirits to
sink. Being by nature an extremist, they sank to
the bottom. All in a twinkling the cooing of
pigeons in my mental picture was changed to the
croaking of ravens. "It's not so very difficult
to get to Bannerley, is it?"</p>

<p>He scratched his head.</p>

<p>"No-o&mdash;not in a general way, miss, but there
ain't no telling <i>when</i> you'll get there."</p>

<p>I drew back, more hurt than angry.</p>

<p>"But my friends have already warned me that
I shall have to change at Leamington&mdash;and Manchester&mdash;and
Oldham&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Can't help that!" he exclaimed heartlessly,
looking over my shoulder at the line of waiting
tourists. "Since the coal strike, trains on them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
side-lines has been as scarce and irregular as a
youngster's teeth at shedding time."</p>

<p>I tried to smile politely, but another glance at
his face showed me that he wasn't expecting such
an act of supererogation.</p>

<p>"Getting off into the unbeaten paths sounds
pretty enough in a guide-book," he kept on hastily,
"but the first thing you do when you meet an unbeaten
path is to want to beat it!"</p>

<p>I faded out of the line and let my successor
take my place.</p>

<p>"He's just an old grouch!" I told myself consolingly,
as I got a seat next a window. "Nothing
really terrible can befall you when traveling&mdash;if
you've got a Masonic pin on your coat!"</p>

<p>(One of my Christie relations had thus decorated
me and assured me.)</p>

<p>Then I forgot all about his gloomy warnings,
for the train rumbled across a thousand street
crossings&mdash;then out into all the sheep pastures in
the civilized world, and&mdash;it was summer!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span></p>

<p>"This country <i>must</i> be Kent!" I mused, not
geographically, but esthetically certain&mdash;as soft
feathery green broke off occasionally into a
pollard-trimmed swamp&mdash;then came up again a
little later into a gentle, sheep-dotted rise. And
I remembered the Duchess once more&mdash;"A stalwart,
fair-haired lover, and a dozen Kentish
lanes!"</p>

<p>I have lived to learn that this is common to
Americans who have been brought up to understand
that Kent is the garden-spot of England.
No matter at which point along the entire coastline
they may board a train, their first conviction
upon seeing suburban scenery is that it <i>must</i> be
Kent! (I say "suburban" advisedly, for none of
it is far enough away from the other to be rural.)</p>

<p>So my journey through an elongated and rather
circuitous Kent kept my mind away from the
croakings of the ticket seller at Paddington&mdash;until
the next morning at daybreak, when I found
myself put down with mournful ceremony at a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
little wayside station which ought to have been
labeled "St. Helena."</p>

<p>"Just as sorry as you are, miss, but this is your
nearest hope for a train to Bannerley!" the guard
said, by way of an appropriate farewell, so off I
got.</p>

<p>"But this place is surely named St. Helena," I
groaned, as I looked about me, yet the only actual
similarity was in the matter of its being entirely
surrounded. The island entirely surrounded by
water, of course&mdash;this station entirely surrounded
by land. I believe that I had never before in my
life seen such a stretch of unimproved property!</p>

<p>"'The woods and I&mdash;and their infinite call,'" I
quoted, as I looked out somewhat shamefacedly
across the acres. For it was exactly the kind of
place I had always longed to possess for my very
own&mdash;yet here I had arrived at it, and might, for
all I knew to the contrary, take possession of it
by right of discovery&mdash;yet I was feeling lonely
and resentful at the very start.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span></p>

<p>Then I remembered Robinson Crusoe and took
heart, straining my eyes in hope of a sail, but
nowhere was there a human face to be seen, nor
sign of life. Not even a freight car stood drearily
on a side-track&mdash;and, as you know, you have to be
very far away from the center of things not to
find a freight car! None was here, however, for
there wasn't a side-track for it to stand upon&mdash;the
main line running in two shining threads far
away toward Ireland.</p>

<p>The only moving bodies visible were a paper
sack being blown gently down the track, a blue
fly buzzing around a blackened banana peeling
and a rook cawing overhead. I looked up at the
rook and smiled philosophically.</p>

<p>"I anticipated a 'coo,' then apprehended a
'croak'&mdash;what I get is a happy compromise, a
'caw,'" I said, and I find that things usually turn
out this way in the great journey of life. Nothing
is ever so good, nor so bad, as you think it's
going to be when you're standing at the ticket
window. The great anticipator is also a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
apprehender&mdash;therefore realization is bound to
be a relief.</p>

<p>Then, as if in reward of my optimism, I began
to scent the odor of escaping coffee.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> inhabited!" I cried.</p>

<p>Springing up, I darted around to the other side
of the station, and there, in a clump of trees,
lying snug and humane-looking in the morning
light, was a tiny cottage. I waited, and presently
there issued from the doorway a man&mdash;wiping
his mouth reminiscently.</p>

<p>He espied me at once and came up, cap in hand.</p>

<p>"Was you wanting something, miss?" he asked.</p>

<p>"A train," I replied, trying to sound inconsequential
with the lordliness that comes of intense
disgust. "I have a ticket to Bannerley&mdash;and I
have friends there <i>waiting</i>!"</p>

<p>The man dared to smile.</p>

<p>"Since the coal strike that's mostly what folks
does, miss," he explained.</p>

<p>There was a moment of strained silence, which
was broken by the appearance of a young boy&mdash;an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
eerie creature who had seemed to glide straight
out of the eastern horizon on a bicycle. The
station-master turned to him.</p>

<p>"Take this here parcel up to Lord Erskine&mdash;and
be quicker than you was yesterday!" he said.</p>

<p>The boy's face and mine changed simultaneously,
his brightening, mine paling.</p>

<p>"Lord Erskine!" I cried, a little ghostly feeling
of fear stealing over me&mdash;for my American
instincts failed to grasp the rapidity with which
dead men's shoes can be snatched off and fitted
with new rubber heels in England&mdash;"Lord
Erskine is dead."</p>

<p>The little messenger boy looked at me pityingly.</p>

<p>"'E <i>wuz</i>," he explained, "but 'e ain't now!"</p>

<p>"And&mdash;and do you mean to tell me that this is
the station for Colmere Abbey?" I demanded,
turning again to the man.</p>

<p>"Yes, miss."</p>

<p>He tried hard not to look supercilious, but
there, six feet above my head, was the name
"Colmere" in faded yellow letters against the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
black background of the sign-board. And I had
always believed in psychic warnings!</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I hadn't thought to look at the sign-board,"
I endeavored to explain. "It seems that it doesn't
matter what your station is, for you're as far
away from your destination at one place as at
another&mdash;during the coal strike! You think I
can't get a train to Bannerley until&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perhaps to-night&mdash;perhaps not until to-morrow
morning," he answered with cruel frankness,
and I knew from heresay that trains did
occasionally wander, comet-fashion, out of their
orbit, and come through stations at unexpected
moments. "Still, there's a railroad hotel about a
mile down the track."</p>

<p>"A railroad hotel?"</p>

<p>"Where the men get their meals&mdash;the guards
and porters!"</p>

<p>My spirits sank.</p>

<p>"That old kill-joy at Paddington knew what he
was talking about!" I said to myself&mdash;then aloud:
"But, couldn't I get a carriage, or a&mdash;&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span></p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"We mostly uses bicycles around here&mdash;when
we don't walk," he explained.</p>

<p>"But I must get to Bannerley!" I burst out in
desperation. "And I am a first-rate walker!
How far is it?"</p>

<p>I was beginning to realize that the adventure
might make good copy, headed: "Wonderful
Pedestrian Journey through Historic Lancashire."
Many a slighter incident has called forth heavier
head-lines.</p>

<p>"Walk?"</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;then take up the matter with the
railroad company in Glasgow, just before I sail
for home!"</p>

<p>My terrible manner caused him to look me over,
quickly.</p>

<p>"Was you wanting to get to the village&mdash;or the
hall?" he asked, evidently impressed by my
severity, and my heart softened.</p>

<p>"To the hall," I answered. "Mrs. Montgomery
is expecting me."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span></p>

<p>He tried hard not to show that he was impressed,
but he failed. Evidently Mrs. Montgomery
was a great personage, and I took on a
tinge of reflected glory not to be entirely ignored.</p>

<p>"The hall is a mile from the village&mdash;and the
village is three miles from here," he explained
gently. "Of course, there's short cuts, if a body
knows 'em&mdash;but for a lady like you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The click of the telegraph instrument clamored
for his attention, so he reluctantly left me. I remained
outside, listening to the caw of the rook.
Presently he came out again.</p>

<p>"There will be a train through here pretty soon&mdash;but
it's coming from the direction of Bannerley
instead of going toward there&mdash;still&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Still, it will give us occasion to hope for better
things later on," I answered cheerfully. "And
it has occurred to me that I might while away a
portion of the morning by walking up to the
gates of Colmere Abbey. That boy went in this
direction, didn't he?"</p>

<p>"Not a quarter of a mile, miss&mdash;down in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
direction," he assured me. "Just follow this
road, and you'll find the lodge in a clump of
trees."</p>

<p>The "May" hedges were glistening with the
early sunbeams, and as I walked down the railroad
track the distance seemed quite a good deal
short of the quarter of a mile mentioned. I
found the clump of trees indicated&mdash;then a small
gray building. My heart bounded, and I rubbed
my eyes to make sure that I was awake.</p>

<p>"Is this the entrance to Colmere Abbey?" I
asked of the boy on the bicycle, who was turning
out of the gate at that moment.</p>

<p>"This is one of the lodges&mdash;but not the grand
one, madam!" he answered anxiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed? But one can get to the park
through this gate?" I persisted.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, madam."</p>

<p>He showed an inclination to act as my esquire,
but I got rid of him by promising him sixpence if
he would take care of my bag until I returned to
the station&mdash;then I crossed the greasy railroad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
track and entered the shade of the trees. It was
far from being my ideal entrée into the old house
of my heart's desire, but it was something of an
adventure&mdash;until I reached the gates. There I
was halted.</p>

<p>"Yes, miss&mdash;if you please?"</p>

<p>It was an acid voice, and I looked at the doorway
of the house, out of which an old woman
was issuing. She was garbed in profound black.</p>

<p>"I want to get in&mdash;to see the grounds of the
abbey," I explained casually, but she was not to
be overwhelmed by any airy nonchalance. She
shook her head.</p>

<p>"But that can't be!"</p>

<p>The smile which accompanied this information
was almost gleeful.</p>

<p>"No? But why not?"</p>

<p>She looked at me pityingly.</p>

<p>"Didn't you know we was in mourning?" she
demanded, bristling with importance.</p>

<p>I instantly made a penitent face, then glanced
appreciatively at her gown, but she gave no evidence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
of being a physiognomist. She failed to
take note of my contrite expression.</p>

<p>"You can't go sight-seeing in here!" she said.</p>

<p>"Not even a little way?"</p>

<p>I accompanied this plea by the display of a
shining half-crown, which I carried in my glove
for emergency. That's one good thing about
being away from the United States&mdash;you don't
have to regard money so tenderly. You realize
that shillings and francs and lire were made to
spend for souvenirs and service, but dollars&mdash;ugh!
They were made to put in the bank! So I
twinkled this ever-ready half-crown temptingly
in the morning light, but she shook her head
again.</p>

<p>"While we was in mourning?" she demanded,
with a gasp of outraged propriety. "Why&mdash;<i>wha'ud
the minister say?</i>"</p>

<p>At this I turned away sadly&mdash;for I had been
in England long enough to know there's never
any use trying to surmise <i>what</i> the minister 'ud
say!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span></p>

<p>"Just the same, you'd make a dandy old servant&mdash;and
I'm a great mind to buy you and put you in
my suit-case, along with the Sheffield candlesticks,"
I thought, as I made my way back to the
station.</p>

<p>During my absence a train had come clattering
in&mdash;and it stood stock-still now, while the
engineer and the station-master held a long conversation
over a basket of homing pigeons which
had been deposited upon the platform. I viewed
the locomotive listlessly enough&mdash;the walk having
taken some of my former impatient energy away,
but my interest was aroused as I came upon the
platform by the appearance of a servant in livery,
disentangling from one of the compartments a
suit-case and leather hat-box.</p>

<p>The man's back was toward me, as he struggled
to lift his burden high above the precious basket
of pigeons which was usurping place and attention,
but the look of the traveling paraphernalia
held my eye for a moment.</p>

<p>"Could it belong to an American?" I mused.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span></p>

<p>The servant deposited the cases on the platform,
then turned, still with his back toward me,
and took part in the lively pigeon argument. I
looked at the beautiful smoothness of the leather.</p>

<p>"Of course they're American!" I decided, for
you must know that nearly any Englishman's
luggage would compare unfavorably with the
bags Aunt Jemima brings with her when she
comes up to the city for a week's mortification to
her nephews.</p>

<p>"Never judge an Englishman by the luggage
he lugs!" is only a fair act of discretion.</p>

<p>I crossed the platform, partly to get away from
the mournful sounds emanating from the wicker
basket, and then, at the door of the little station
I was arrested by another sound. It was a sound
which had certainly not been there when I had
left, half an hour before! I halted&mdash;wondering
if there really could be anything in psychic warnings!</p>

<p>Inside the dingy little room some one was
whistling! The melody was falling upon the air
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
with a certain softness which, however, did not
conceal its suppressed vehemence&mdash;and the tune
was <i>Caro Mio Ben!</i></p>

<p>"Anybody has a right to whistle it!" I told
myself savagely, but I still hesitated&mdash;my heart
standing still from the mere force of the hypothesis.
After a moment it began beating again, as if
to make up for lost time.</p>

<p>The whistling man inside left off his music&mdash;then
I heard his footsteps tramping impatiently
across the bare wooden floor. He finally came
to the door and looked out. I glanced up, and
our eyes met! It <i>was Caro Mio Ben! It was
Caro Mio Ben!</i></p>

<p>"Well?" he said.</p>

<p>He stood perfectly still for half a minute it
seemed&mdash;making no effort toward a civilized
greeting.</p>

<p>"Well!" I responded&mdash;as soon as I could.</p>

<p>"This is queer, isn't it?"</p>

<p>I looked at him.</p>

<p>"'Queer?'" I managed to repeat&mdash;that is, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
heard the word escaping past the tightening
muscles of my throat. "<i>Queer!</i>"</p>

<p>"Most extraordinary!"</p>

<p>"I should&mdash;I think I should like to sit down!"
I decided, as he continued to stand staring at me,
and I suddenly realized that I was very tired.</p>

<p>He moved aside.</p>

<p>"By all means! Come in and sit down, Miss
Christie. This station fellow here tells me that
you have been disappointed in your train."</p>

<p>"I have," I answered.</p>

<p>I might have added that I had been disappointed
in everything most important in life, as
well&mdash;but his own face was wearing such an expression
of calm serenity that I was soothed as I
looked at it.</p>

<p>"That's quite a problem here in England just
now," he observed politely.</p>

<p>"So I have been informed."</p>

<p>After this, conversation flagged, until the
silence made me nervous.</p>

<p>"I should think we ought to be asking each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
other&mdash;questions!" I suggested, trying to bring
him to a realization of the necessary formalities,
but he only turned and looked down at me, with a
slightly amused, slightly superior smile.</p>

<p>"Questions?"</p>

<p>"About <i>ships</i>&mdash;and how long we intend staying&mdash;and
what travelers usually ask!" I said.</p>

<p>He shook his head, as if the subjects held little
interest for him.</p>

<p>"Why should I ask that&mdash;when I happen to
know?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"You know&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"That you came over on the <i>Luxuria</i>."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"And that <i>The Oldburgh Herald</i> sent you&mdash;to
write up the coal strike."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;it did."</p>

<p>"And that you are going to stay&mdash;some time."</p>

<p>I was decidedly uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"Will you please explain how you knew all
this?" I asked.</p>

<p>His smile died away.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span></p>

<p>"Mrs. Hiram Walker wrote her son to call on
me while I was in New York," he explained in
his serious lawyer-like manner, "and he happened
to leave a copy of <i>The Oldburgh Herald</i> in my
rooms."</p>

<p>"Oh! That was quite simple, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Quite!"</p>

<p>It occurred to me then that there was no use
trying to keep fate's name out of this conversation&mdash;and
also it came to me that the orchids
were no longer a mystery&mdash;but before I could
make up my mind to mention this he turned to
me ferociously.</p>

<p>"You <i>did</i> make a fool of me!" he accused.</p>

<p>My heart began thumping again.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I began, but he cut me
short.</p>

<p>"It is this that I can not get over! The thought
has come to me that perhaps if I might hear you
acknowledge it, I might be able to forgive you
better."</p>

<p>"Forgive me?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span></p>

<p>He leaned toward me.</p>

<p>"If you don't mind, I should like to hear you
say: 'Maitland Tait, I did make a fool of you!'"</p>

<p>"But I didn't!" I denied stoutly, while my face
flushed, and all the fighting blood in me seemed
to send forth a challenge from my cheeks. "I'll
say what I <i>do</i> think, however, if you wish to hear
it!"</p>

<p>"And that is&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Maitland Tait, you made a fool of yourself!"</p>

<p>He looked disappointed.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know that!" he replied.</p>

<p>"You do? Since when, please?"</p>

<p>"Why, I knew it before I crossed the Ohio
River!" he acknowledged, seeming to take some
pride in the fact. "I&mdash;I intended to apologize&mdash;or
something&mdash;when I got to Pittsburgh, but
when I reached New York, on my way here, I
saw that you were coming to England, too&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So you thought the matter could easily wait&mdash;I
see!" I observed, then, to change the subject, I
asked: "Have you been here long?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span></p>

<p>"Two weeks! I knew that I should get news
of you in <i>this</i> neighborhood, sooner or later."</p>

<p>I instantly smiled.</p>

<p>"I have come here for my first Sunday, you
see, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you haven't been to the abbey yet, have
you?" he asked.</p>

<p>The boyish anxiety in his tone gave me a thrill.
Something in the thought of his remembering my
romantic whim touched me.</p>

<p>"No. I have just come from there&mdash;the lodge&mdash;but
the old woman at the gates wouldn't let me
in."</p>

<p>He looked interested.</p>

<p>"No? But why not?"</p>

<p>"The master of the house has just died," I explained.
"It would be a terrible breach of
etiquette to go sight-seeing over the mourning
acres."</p>

<p>His lips closed firmly.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! I'll venture that's just a servant's
whim." He slipped out his watch. "Shall I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
go over and try to beg or bribe permission for
you? I'm not easily daunted by their refusals,
and&mdash;I'll have a little time to spare this morning,
if you'd care to put your marooned period to
such a use."</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> marooned," I told him, wondering for
a moment what the Montgomerys would think of
my delay, "and I should like this, of course, above
anything else that England has to offer, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then, after his precipitate fashion, he waited
for no more. He paused at the edge of the platform
for a low-toned colloquy with Collins&mdash;I
could easily distinguish now that the liveried creature
was Collins&mdash;and the two disappeared down
the car track. After the briefest delay he returned.</p>

<p>"What can't be cured must be ignored," he
said with a shrug, as he came up. "The poor old
devil evidently regards us as very impious and&mdash;American,
but I made everything all right with
her."</p>

<p>"But how&mdash;&mdash;?" I started to inquire, also at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
the same moment starting down the track toward
the lodge house, when he stopped both my question
and my progress.</p>

<p>"Let us wait here&mdash;I have sent Collins to get a
car for us from the garage not far away."</p>

<p>He led the way out to a drive, sheltered with
trees, on the other side of the track, and we
awaited the coming of Collins&mdash;neither showing
any disposition to talk.</p>

<p>"Is this <i>your</i> car?" I presently asked, as the
servant driving a gleaming black machine drew
up in front of us. "I hadn't imagined that you
would have your own car down in the country
with you."</p>

<p>"I've had experience with these trains," he explained
briefly, then he looked the car over with
a masterful eye. "Yes, it's mine."</p>

<p>"I really shouldn't have needed to ask&mdash;there's
so strong a family resemblance to the other one&mdash;the
limousine you had in Oldburgh."</p>

<p>He looked pleased.</p>

<p>"I hope you'll like this one&mdash;it's a Blanton Six,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
you see," he explained with a pat of affectionate
pride upon the door-handle as he helped me in.</p>

<p>Collins climbed to his place at the wheel, and
without another word&mdash;without one backward
look&mdash;I was whirled away into the Land of Long
Ago&mdash;the period where I had always belonged.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>At the second lodge&mdash;the grand one&mdash;I pinched
myself. I had to, to see whether I was awake&mdash;or
dreaming a Jane Austen dream. Maitland
Tait, watching me closely, saw the act.</p>

<p>"You're quite awake," he assured me gravely.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;what are you?" I inquired. "Are you
yourself&mdash;or Aladdin, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I broke off abruptly, for the car was gliding
over a bridge, and underneath was a silvery,
glinting ribbon, that might, in fairy-land, pass
for a river.</p>

<p>"Shall I stop the car and let you dabble the
toe of your shoe in the water?" my guide asked.</p>

<p>I looked at him in bewilderment.</p>

<p>"I shan't be able to believe it's just water&mdash;unless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
you do," I explained. He had seen the
look I let fall upon the shining breast of the
stream.</p>

<p>"And I'll send Collins away."</p>

<p>"Of course! It's sacrilegious to let any
wooden-faced human look upon&mdash;all this!"</p>

<p>The car obediently let us out, then steamed
softly away, up the road and out of sight.</p>

<p>Mr. Tait held out his hand to me and helped
me down the steep little river bank. I dabbled
the toe of my shoe in the water, and as he finally
drew me away, with the suggestion of further
delights, I caught sight of a tiny fish, lying whitely
upward in a tangle of weeds.</p>

<p>"How <i>could</i> he die?" I asked mournfully, as
we walked away and climbed back to the level of
the park. "It seems so unappreciative."</p>

<p>The man beside me laughed.</p>

<p>"<i>Things</i>&mdash;even the most beautiful things on
earth&mdash;don't keep people&mdash;or fish alive," he said.
"They can't even make people want to stay alive&mdash;if
this is all they have, and after all, the river
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
is just a thing&mdash;and the park is a thing&mdash;and the
house is a thing!"</p>

<p>We had walked on rapidly, and at that moment
the house itself became apparent. I clutched his
arm.</p>

<p>"A thing!" I denied, looking at it in a dazed
fashion. "Why, it's the House of a Hundred
Dreams! It's all the dreams of April mornings&mdash;and
Christmas nights&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And what?" he asked gravely. But my eyes
were still intoxicated.</p>

<p>"Why, it's Religion&mdash;and Art&mdash;and <i>Love</i>&mdash;and
Comfort!"</p>

<p>He looked at it wonderingly, as if he expected
to see statues representing these chapters in the
book of Life.</p>

<p>What he saw was a tangle of gravel walks,
gray as the desert, drawing away from grassy
places and coming up sharply against the house.
<i>Such</i> a house! A church&mdash;a tomb&mdash;a fluttering-curtained
living-hall&mdash;all stretched out in one long
chain of battlemented stone. Where the church
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
began and the living-hall ended no one could say,
for there were trees everywhere.</p>

<p>"The lower part of the abbey is in good condition,
it seems," my conductor remarked, as we
approached.</p>

<p>"Good condition!" I echoed. "Why, those
doorways are as realistic as&mdash;Sunday morning!
I feel that I ought to have on a silk dress&mdash;and
hold the corners of my prayer-book with a handkerchief&mdash;to
keep from soiling my white gloves."</p>

<p>"If you listen perhaps you can hear the choir-boys,"
he said, after a pause, and without smiling.</p>

<p>"But there might be a sermon, too!" I objected.</p>

<p>High above the doors was a great open space
of a missing window; then, over this, smaller
spaces for smaller windows; and&mdash;in a niched
pinnacle&mdash;the Virgin.</p>

<p>"How can she&mdash;a woman in love&mdash;endure all
this beauty?" I asked, my voice hushed with awe.</p>

<p>"She's endured it for many centuries, it seems,"
he answered.</p>

<p>But we came closer then.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, she hasn't even seen it&mdash;not once!" I
cried, for I saw then that she was not looking
up, but down&mdash;at the burden in her arms.</p>

<p>Instinctively Maitland Tait bared his head as
we crossed the threshold.</p>

<p>"Shall we try to find a way through here into
the gardens?" he asked.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<span class="s08">HOUSE OF A HUNDRED DREAMS</span></h2>

<p>The shadows inside the roofless old abbey
were warm and friendly. The sunlight
gleamed against the tombs with a cheer which
always falls over very old grief spots.</p>

<p>"This quietude&mdash;this sense of all rightness&mdash;makes
you feel that nothing really matters,
doesn't it?" I asked, looking around with a sort
of awed delight as we paused to read one or two
inscriptions&mdash;voluminous in length and medieval
in spelling.</p>

<p>The man at my side was less awed.</p>

<p>"Shall we go on to the gardens, then?" he
asked. "You'll not think so little of temporal
pleasures there, perhaps."</p>

<p>I looked up at him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span></p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"Well, because these gardens are usually filled
with suggestions of living joys&mdash;for one thing.
There are millions of forget-me-nots, which always
give a cheering aspect to the landscape&mdash;and
there are frequently the flowers mentioned in
Shakespeare's plays."</p>

<p>With a sigh of regret we left the sanctuary.
Then, turning a corner of the old stone wall we
came full upon a side of the house which was
receiving shamelessly the biggest sun-kiss I had
ever seen. But then, it was the biggest house I
had ever seen. It was the gladdest sun&mdash;and it
was the warmest blending. Between house and
sun&mdash;as if they were the love children of this
union&mdash;lay thousands of brilliant flowers.</p>

<p>When I could get my breath I made a quick
suggestion that we go closer.</p>

<p>"I want to know which is rosemary&mdash;and
which is rue!" I told him. But he stopped a
moment and detained me.</p>

<p>We halted beside a fallen stone, at a point
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
slightly separated from the walls of the house&mdash;a
sort of half-way ground, where the shadow of
the Greek cross on an isolated pinnacle seemed
still to claim the ground for religion, against the
encroachments of the work-a-day world. Maitland
Tait's sudden smile was a mixture of amusement
and tenderness.</p>

<p>"I've recently heard a story about this spot&mdash;this
identical stone&mdash;which will interest you," he
said. "A monk comes here at night&mdash;one of
those old fellows buried in there."</p>

<p>I smiled.</p>

<p>"It's quite true!" he insisted. "People have
seen him."</p>

<p>"I know it," I avowed seriously. "I was not
smiling out of unbelief, but out of sheer joy at
beholding with mine own eyes the 'Norman
stone!'</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"'He mutters his prayers on the midnight air,</p>
<p>And his mass of the days that are gone.'"</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Maitland Tait looked at me in surprise.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you know all the legends of the place?" he
asked.</p>

<p>I shook my head sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"I wish I did," I replied. "For so many years
this has been my House of a Hundred Dreams!"</p>

<p>We both fell into a moment's dreamy thoughtfulness,
which I was first to cast aside.</p>

<p>"Come and tell me about the plants, if you
can!" I begged. "Which <i>is</i> rosemary, and which
is rue?"</p>

<p>We walked down a flight of worn steps, and
came upon prim gravel pathways.</p>

<p>"This is rosemary," he said, "and here, by the
sun-dial, is rue."</p>

<p>Then, even when I realized that this was the
place where Lady Frances Webb had spent her
wearisome days, to keep from hearing the clock
chime in the hall, I could not be sad. The sun-dial
was another grief spot, it was true, but it
was an ancient grief spot&mdash;and it was located in
a golden sea of sunshine, under a sky that was
the reflection of forget-me-nots.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span></p>

<p>"She could gather the rue while the sun-dial
told, all silently, of the day's wearing on," I said.</p>

<p>He looked at me uncertainly.</p>

<p>"Did she say that in her letters?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. She had sent her lover away, you see,
and&mdash;there was nothing else in life."</p>

<p>"And she longed for the days to pass silently?"</p>

<p>"She stayed out here as much as she could&mdash;to
keep from hearing the clock in the hall," I told
him. "The chime shamed the unholy prayer on
her lips, she said&mdash;and the sound of the ticking
reminded her of her heart's wearying beats."</p>

<p>"Of <i>their</i> hearts' wearying beats, you mean,"
he exclaimed, and a quick look of pain which
darted into his face showed me that he comprehended.
Then, for the first time, I began to
grasp what a lover he would make! Before this
time I had been absorbed with thoughts of him
as a beloved.</p>

<p>Suddenly my hat began to feel intolerably
heavy, and my gloves intolerably hot. I tampered
fumblingly with the pearl clasp at my left wrist,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
and drew that glove off first. Maitland Tait was
watching me. He saw my hand&mdash;my bare ringless
hand. He stared at it as if it might have
been a ghost, although it looked fairly pink and
healthy in the warm glow of the noonday sun.
Even the little pallid circle on the third finger was
quite gone.</p>

<p>"Grace&mdash;&mdash;" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Does this mean that you're&mdash;you're&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A discreet cough&mdash;a still distant, but distinctly
warning cough&mdash;interrupted for a moment. Collins
was coming toward us, from the ruins of
the old abbey. Maitland Tait looked up and saw
him coming, but he did not stop. On the other
hand, the sight of his servant seemed to goad him
into a hasty precipitation.</p>

<p>"Grace, will you marry me?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Of <i>course</i>!" I managed to say, but not too
energetically, for the muscles of my throat were
giving me trouble again.</p>

<p>"Soon?" he asked hungrily.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span></p>

<p>I felt very reckless and&mdash;American.</p>

<p>"Before the shadows pass round this dial again,
if you <i>insist</i>," I smiled.</p>

<p>But his eyes were very grave.</p>

<p>"Without knowing anything more about me
than you know now?"</p>

<p>"Why, I know everything about you," I replied,
in some astonishment. "I know that you are the
biggest, and the best-looking, and the dearest&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You know nothing about me," he interrupted
softly, "except what I have told you. I am a
working man! I have always had the mass
hatred for class, and&mdash;and my grandfather was
a coal-digger in Wales."</p>

<p>I was silent.</p>

<p>"Yet, you are willing to marry me?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Of course! Coal is&mdash;very warming," I answered.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>Collins descended the flight of stone steps and
came slowly along the gravel walk. When he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
had come to the respectful distance he stopped.
No English servant ever approaches very close&mdash;as
if there were a quarantine around the sacred
person of the served.</p>

<p>"My Lord," he said, but stammeringly, as a
man halts over a newly-acquired language&mdash;"My
Lord, Mrs. Carr wishes to know if you will have
lunch served in the oak room, or in the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In the oak room," the man standing beside me
answered readily enough. "And have the old
wing opened and lighted, Collins. We want to
see the pictures in there."</p>

<p>The servant breathed the inevitable "Thank
you," and turned away.</p>

<p>I seemed suddenly to feel that the golden sea
of sunlight was sweeping me away&mdash;up into the
blue, which was the reflection of forget-me-nots.
And there loomed big on my horizon a house
that was a home!</p>

<p>"My <i>Lord</i>?" I demanded, as soon as I could
speak.</p>

<p>Maitland Tait nodded reassuringly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span></p>

<p>"My father died two weeks ago," he said.
"And I <i>had</i> to come into the title."</p>

<p>"And this place is <i>yours</i>!" I sang out, feeling
that all the years of my life I had been destiny's
love-child. "This old abbey is yours! The park
is yours! The garden is yours! The sun-dial is
yours!"</p>

<p>"And the girl is mine!" he said, with a grave
smile. "I am careless of all the other."</p>

<p>His gravity sobered my wild spirits.</p>

<p>"And your father was&mdash;Lord Erskine?" I
finally asked.</p>

<p>"He <i>was</i>&mdash;Lord Erskine," he answered. "He
married out of his station&mdash;far, far above his
station, <i>I</i> think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>His big beautiful mouth set grimly, but he said
nothing more, and I knew that this was as heavily
as he would ever tread upon the ashes of the dead.
Gradually, bit by bit, I learned the history of the
muddy pool of mistake and fault, out of which
the tender blossom of his boyhood had been
dragged. His father had never seen him, but a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
certain stiff-necked family pride had caused him
to provide material bounty for his child. The
combination of a good education and rugged
plebeian industry had made him what he was.</p>

<p>"But why didn't you tell me&mdash;that day when
you first came to see me and we talked about this
place&mdash;why didn't you tell me that it was <i>your</i>
ancestral home?"</p>

<p>He looked at me in surprise.</p>

<p>"Why, because I had made up my mind to
marry you!" he said. "You told me that this
old place was a sort of dreamland of yours&mdash;and
I didn't want to complicate matters. I wanted
your love for me to be a reality."</p>

<p>"Well, it&mdash;it is!" I confessed.</p>

<p>After a long while&mdash;that is, the sun-dial said
it was a long while&mdash;spent this way a sudden
thought of my waiting hosts at Bannerley came
over me. I sprang up from the step of the
pedestal where we had been sitting.</p>

<p>"I <i>must</i> get some word to Mrs. Montgomery!"
I said. "They will be thinking that my rash
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
American ways have got me into some dreadful
scrape, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>But the serene man at my side was still serene.
His face looked as if nothing on earth could ever
cause him a pang again. He caught my hand
and drew me gently, but rather steadfastly back
to my place.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Montgomery knows everything&mdash;except
that we are going to be married&mdash;when did you
say, to-morrow?" he smiled. "I've been staying
with them, and they told me about you, and I
told them about you&mdash;and we had rather a satisfactory
adjustment of neighborly relations."</p>

<p>I looked at him in awe. I could not quite
shake off the idea that he had a miraculous lamp
hidden about somewhere in his pockets. Things
seemed to <i>happen</i> when he wished them to happen.</p>

<p>"Did you chance to know that I would take a
bad train and be delayed here this morning at
sunrise?" I asked, trying to look dignified and
unawed. "Did you know that I should be compelled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
to waste precious morning hours pacing up
and down a railway station platform?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course," he answered imperturbably.
"Mrs. Montgomery sent me over to meet you."</p>

<p>I sprang up again, more energetically this time.</p>

<p>"Then why didn't you meet me?" I asked, with
the horror of shocking English propriety overwhelming
me. "Come! We must go to Bannerley
at once."</p>

<p>He rose and followed me toward the main garden
path. Then he pointed the way to the house
door.</p>

<p>"I've had Collins telephone that your train was
very, very late," he explained. "She'll not be
surprised&mdash;nor too inquisitive. She even suggested
this morning that if you shouldn't get in
until evening&mdash;the drive to Bannerley is very fine
by moonlight."</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>In the late afternoon the chilly dusk sent little
forerunners ahead, which caused the old wing of
the house to be lighted from within, instead of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
opened to the cool dying sunset. A cheery fire
was kindled in the room which had once been the
library of Lady Frances Webb.</p>

<p>The dampness and air of disuse disappeared,
and it seemed as if personalities came forth from
the shadowy corners and sat beside the fire with
Maitland Tait and me.</p>

<p>"This was her own desk, they tell me," he said,
as he was showing the ancient treasures to me,
yet still looking at them himself with half-awed,
almost unbelieving eyes. "This was where all
her famous books were written."</p>

<p>I crossed the room to where the little locked
secretary stood. Its polished surface was sending
back the firelight's glow and seemed to proclaim
that its own mahogany was imprisoned sunshine.</p>

<p>"And she wrote those letters here," I said in
a hushed voice. "Do you suppose she has some
of his letters locked away somewhere?"</p>

<p>He nodded, fitting the key to its lock very carefully.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_341.jpg" width="347" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption">He drew me to a corner of the room</p>
</div>

<p>"All of them! All the letters written her by&mdash;Uncle
James."</p>

<p>"And we are going to look over them together&mdash;you
and I are going to read these love-letters&mdash;before
we burn them?" I asked, quick joy making
my voice tremulous.</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence in the old
room, then he turned away from the secretary,
and came very close.</p>

<p>"Why burn them&mdash;now?" he asked, his own
strong voice of a sudden more tremulous than
mine. "Why burn them, now, darling? Why
not&mdash;hand&mdash;them&mdash;down?"</p>

<p>Then&mdash;in that instant&mdash;I knew what life was
going to mean to me. And I felt as if I had the
great joy of the world&mdash;hugged close&mdash;in a circle
of radiance&mdash;like the <i>Madonna della Sedia</i>!</p>

<p>"I can be good&mdash;a very good woman&mdash;if I
have your face before me," I told him.</p>

<p>After a while he smiled, then took my hand
and drew me to a shadowy corner of the room.</p>

<p>"You haven't seen this yet," he said.

<p>There was a crimson velvet curtain hanging
before a picture, and he drew aside the folds.</p>

<p>"This is&mdash;Uncle James,"</p>

<p>The candlelight shone against the canvas, and
glittered in dancing little waves over the name-plate
on the frame.</p>

<p>"<i>Portrait of the Artist, by Himself.</i>"</p>

<p>"Was it a comfort to her, I wonder?" my lover
said, his thoughts only half with the past.</p>

<p>"A torturing comfort&mdash;the kind a woman like
her demands," I answered. "She had to go to
it every hour in every day&mdash;and look at it&mdash;to
make her heart ache, because it was only a picture.
She was a human being&mdash;as well as a
novelist, so that such as this could only add to her
anguish. She wanted a <i>living</i> face&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She wanted&mdash;this?"</p>

<p>He set the candlestick down and put both arms
round me.</p>

<p>"She wanted&mdash;<i>this</i>?" he breathed.</p>

<p>His face was close above mine-waiting for
the first kiss. A moment later it came&mdash;descending

gently, like some blessed holy thing. And it
was that.</p>

<p>"You are like him," I whispered. "Your face
can make me good."</p>

<p>His arms tightened, and a smile escaped.</p>

<p>"And yours? What will you be like to me?"
he asked.</p>

<p>I looked up, remembering.</p>

<p>"Like&mdash;just an American woman&mdash;a tormenting
side-issue in your busy life?"</p>

<p>But he shook his head gravely.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not that."</p>

<p>A casement was open near by, and he drew me
toward the shaft of radiance which fell into the
shadowed room.</p>

<p>Across the courtyard, white now with moonlight,
were the ruins of the abbey. There shone
a softened luster through the space of the absent
window, and above, resplendent in her niche,
stood the Virgin. Her head was bowed above the
burden in her arms.</p>

<p>"Like that&mdash;<i>like that</i>!" he whispered.</p>

<p class="center p4">THE END</p>
